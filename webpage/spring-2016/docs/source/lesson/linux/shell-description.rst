A "shell" is a program that facilitates interaction between human and
computer.
By providing this level of abstraction certain tasks which may be
otherwise cumbersome of time-consuming are relatively simple to
accomplish.
There are numerous types of shells.
If you have ever used a computer you have used a shell.
For instance, Windows and Mac OS X use a shell based on graphical
representations with a mouse and keyboard for interaction.
Touch-screen phones and tables also use another type of shell whose
mode of interaction is through touch.
In addition to these which you might be familiar with, we will be using
a command shell to interact with the computer primarily through the
keyboard.
