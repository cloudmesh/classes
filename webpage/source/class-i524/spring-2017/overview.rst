About the Course
-----------------

This course is an overview course in Data Science and covers the
applications and technologies (data analytics and clouds) needed to
process the application data. It is organized around rallying cry: Use
Clouds running Data Analytics Collaboratively processing Big Data to
solve problems in X-Informatics.

Requirements
------------

This course assumes knowledge of programming in python, the Linux
shell, and shell scripting. If you are unfamiliar with these topics,
you may still take the course, but be aware that completion of the
assignments and projects will require additional time needed by you to
become familiar with them. We have provided additional information as
part of the course material that assists you in learning about them.

Common Mistakes
---------------

* Starting the Project late.
* Not using gitlab for homework submission
* Not using the 2 column ACM report template
* Not using jabref or endnote for References
* Not understanding plagiarism
* Being in a team where one team member does not perform
* Violating university policy by doing another students work
* Not using frequent checkins to gitlab and pushing the commits
  

Systems Usage
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Projects may be executed on your local computer, a cloud or other
resources you may have access to. This may include:

* chameleoncloud.org
* furturesystems.org
* AWS (you will be responsible for charges)
* Azure (you will be responsible for charges)
* virtualbox if you have a powerful computer and like to prototype
* other clouds


Term Paper or Project
----------------------------------------------------------------------

.. todo:: verify this policy for this class

You have a choice to write a term paper or do a software project. This
will constitute to **50%** of your class grade.

In case you chose a project your maximum grade could be an
A+. However, an A+ project must be truly outstanding and include an
exceptional project report. Such a project and report will have the
potential quality of being able to be published in a conference.

In case you chose a Term Paper your maximum Grade for the entire class
will be an A-.

Please note that a project includes also writing a project
report/paper. However the length is a bit lower than for a term paper.


.. _overview-software-project:

Software Project
----------------

In case of a software project, we encourage a group project with up to
three members.  You can use the
`discussion forum in the folder project <https://piazza.com/class/irqfvh1ctrg2vt>`_
to form project teams or just communicate privately with other class
members to formulate a team. The following artifacts are part of the
deliverables for a project

Code:
    You must deliver the code in gitlab. The code must be compilable
    and a TA may try to replicate to run your code. You MUST avoid
    lengthy install descriptions and everything must be installable
    from the command line. We will check submission. All team members
    must be responsible for one part of the project.

Project Report:
    A report must be produced while using the format discussed in the
    Report Format section. The following length is required:

    * 4 pages, one student in the project
    * 6 pages, two students in the project
    * 8 pages, three students in the project

Work Breakdown:
    This document is only needed for team projects. A one page PDF
    document describing who did what. It includes pointers to
    the git history that documents the statistics that demonstrate not
    only one student has worked on the project.

    In addition the graders will go into gitlab, which provides a
    history of checkins to verify each team member has used gitlab to
    checkin their contributions frequently. E.g. if we find that one
    of the students has not checked in code or documentation at all,
    it will be questioned.

License:
    All projects are developed under an open source license such as
    Apache 2.0 License, or similar. You will be required to add a
    LICENCE.txt file and if you use other software identify how it can be
    reused in your project. If your project uses different licenses,
    please add in a README.rst file which packages are used and which
    license these packages have.

Term Paper
-----------

.. todo:: fix piazza link

Teams:
    Up to three people. You can use the
    `discussion forum in the folder term-project <https://piazza.com/class/irqfvh1ctrg2vt>`_
    to build teams.

Term Report:
    A report must be produced while using the format discussed in the
    Report Format section. The following length is required:

    In case you chose the term paper, you or your team will pick a topic
    relevant for the class. You will write a high quality scholarly paper
    about this topic. The following artifacts are part of the deliverables
    for a term paper. A report must be produced while using the format discussed in the
    Report Format section. The following length is required:

    * 6 pages, one student in the project
    * 9 pages, two student in the project
    * 12 pages, three student in the project


Work Breakdown:
    This document is only needed for team projects. A one page PDF
    document describing who did what.

Grading:
    As stated above the maximum grade for the entire class will be A-
    if you deliver a very good paper. However, axceptional term papers
    are possible and could result in higher grades. They must contain
    significant contributions and novel ideas so that the paper could
    be published in a conference or journal. A comprehensive survey
    would be an example. The page limitation will most likely be
    exceeded by such work. Number of pages is not reflecting quallity.
    Refernces must be outstanding.

Report Format
---------------

.. todo:: THIS SECTION WILL CHNAGE, WE WILL ONLY ACCEPT SHARELATEX, WE
	  MAY USE SIMPLER FORMAT SUCH AS SPRINGER BOOK 

All reports will be using the ACM proceedings format. The MSWord template
can be found here:

* :download:`paper-report.docx <files/paper-report.docx>`

A LaTeX version can be found at

* https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template

however you have to remove the ACM copyright notice in the LaTeX version.

There will be **NO EXCEPTION** to this format. In case you are in a
team, you can use either gitlab while collaboratively developing the
LaTeX document or use MicrosoftOne Drive which allows collaborative
editing features. All bibliographical entries must be put into a
bibliography manager such as jabref, endnote, or Mendeley. This will
guarantee that you follow proper citation styles. You can use either
ACM or IEEE reference styles. Your final submission will include the
bibliography file as a separate document.

Documents that do not follow the ACM format and are not accompanied by
references managed with jabref or endnote or are not spell checked
will be returned without review.

Report Checklist:

* [ ] Have you written the report in word or LaTeX in the specified
  format.

Code Repositories Deliverables
------------------------------

Code repositories are for code, if you have additional libraries that
are needed you need to develop a script or use a DevOps framework to
install such software. Thus zip files and .class, .o files are not
permissible in the project. Each project must be reproducible with a
simple script. An example is::

    git clone ....
    make install
    make run
    make view

Which would use a simple make file to install, run, and view the
results. Naturally you can use ansible or shell scripts. It is not
permissible to use GUI based DevOps preinstalled
frameworks. Everything must be installable form the command line.


Prerequisites
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Python or Java experience is expected. The programming load is modest.

In case you elect a programming project we will assume that you are
familiar with the programming languages required as part of the
project you suggest. We will limit the languages to Python and
JavaScript if you like to do interactive visualization.  If you do not
know the required technologies, we will expect you to learn it outside
of class. For example, Python has a reputation for being easy to
learn, and those with strong programming background in another
general-purpose programming language (like C/C++, Java, Ruby, etc.)
can learn it within a few hours to days dependent on experience
level. Please consult the instructor if you have concerns about your
programming background. In addition, we may encounter math of various
kinds, including linear algebra, probability theory, and basic
calculus. We expect that you know them on an elementary
level. Students with limited math backgrounds may need to do
additional reading outside of class.

In case you are interested in further development of cloudmesh for big
data strong Python or JavaScript experience is needed.

You will also need a sufficiently modern and powerful computer to do
the class work. Naturally if you expect that you want to to the course
only on your cell phone or iPad, or your windows 98 computer, this
does not work. We recommend that you have a relatively new and updated
computer with sufficient memory. In some cases its easier to not use
Windows and for example use Linux via virtualbox, so your machine
should have sufficient memory to comfortably run it. If you do not
have such a machine we are at this time trying to get virtual machines
that you can use on our cloud. However, runtime of these VMs is
limited to 6 hours and they will be terminated after that. Naturally
you can run new VMs. This is done in order to avoid resource "hogging"
of idle VMs. In contrast to AWS you are not paying for our VMs so we
enforce a rule to encourage proper community spirit while not
occupying resources that could be used by others. Certainly you can
naturally also use AWS or other clouds where you can run virtual
machines, but in that case you need to pay for the usage yourself.

Please remember that this course does not have a required text books
and the money you safe on this you can be used to buy a new or upgrade
your current computer if needed.


Learning Outcomes
-----------------

Students will gain broad understanding of Big Data application areas and
approaches used. This course is a good preparation for any student
likely to be involved with Big Data in their future.


Grading
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Grading for homework will be done within a week of submission on the
due date. For homework that were submitted beyond the due date, the
grading will be done within 2-3 weeks after the submission. A 10%
grade reduction will be given. Some homework can not be delivered late
(which will be clearly marked and 0 points will be given if
late; these are mostly related to setting up your account and
communicating to us your account names.)

It is the student’s responsibility to upload submissions well ahead of
the deadline to avoid last minute problems with network connectivity,
browser crashes, cloud issues, etc. It is a very good idea to make
early submissions and then upload updates as the deadline approaches;
we will grade the last submission received before the deadline.

Note that paper and project will take a considerable amount of time
and doing proper time management is a must for this class. Avoid
starting your project late. Procrastination does not pay off. Late
Projects or term papers will receive a 10% grade reduction.

* 40% Homework
* 50% Term Paper or Project
* 10% Participation/Discussion

Details about the assignments can be found in the Section :ref:`assignments`.


Academic Integrity Policy
----------------------------------------------------------------------

We take academic integrity very seriously. You are required to abide
by the Indiana University policy on academic integrity, as described
in the Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct, as well
as the Computer Science Statement on Academic Integrity
(http://www.soic.indiana.edu/doc/graduate/graduate-forms/Academic-Integrity-Guideline-FINAL-2015.pdf). It
is your responsibility to understand these policies. Briefly
summarized, the work you submit for course assignments, projects,
quizzes, and exams must be your own or that of your group, if
group work is permitted. You may use the ideas of others but you must
give proper credit. You may discuss assignments with other students
but you must acknowledge them in the reference section according to
scholarly citation rules. Please also make sure that you know how to
not plagiarize text from other sources while reviewing citation rules.

We will respond to acts of plagiarism and academic misconduct
according to university policy. Sanctions typically involve a grade of
0 for the assignment in question and/or a grade of F in the course. In
addition, University policy requires us to report the incident to the
Dean of Students, who may apply additional sanctions, including
expulsion from the university.

Students agree that by taking this course, papers and source code
submitted to us may be subject to textual similarity review, for
example by Turnitin.com. These submissions may be included as source
documents in reference databases for the purpose of detecting
plagiarism of such papers or codes.
