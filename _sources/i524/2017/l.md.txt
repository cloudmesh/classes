Based on our experience with residential and online classes we will for
the first time not require that you have to do the class videos at a
particular time once they are released. This, however, has the danger
that you are not watching them at all and you cheat yourself as you do
not allow yourself the educational lessons that this class offers to
you. It also requires you to assemble your own schedule for watching the
videos that will have to be managed through Github as part of a
README.md file in your git repository. You will need to do the
technology track, the communications track, as well as the theory track.

Theory Track:

:   Some lectures have been designed to introduce you to a number of
    technologies. These lectures are of more theoretical nature and do
    not require much hands on activities. Thus you can start them any
    time.

Collaboration Track:

:   These lectures provide the tools for you to collaborate with your
    peers and with instructors.

Systems Track:

:   These lectures cover topics that are fundamental to executing your
    project.

Technology Track:

:   These are lectures with strong technology content and introduce you
    to using a selected number of technologies as part of the class. It
    is expected that you will use them as part of the project. Instead
    of slowing you down with graded homework we expect that you learn
    these technologies and reuse them as part of the project. It would
    be a big mistake to start the project 2 weeks before the semester
    ends, you will not succeed. You must start your project in the first
    month of the course. Progress is reported on a monthly basis while
    the report is updated and snapshot every month. We will monitor your
    progress and include them into the discussion grade. For residential
    students there should be no reason why you can not provide a monthly
    update. For online students, a valid update would be: "I changed my
    company and could not work on the project due to moving". This will
    give you some points if submitted in time. However, if you submit
    nothing, we will not issue any points.
