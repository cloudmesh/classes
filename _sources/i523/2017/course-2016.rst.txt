Introduction
---------------

.. note:: You may find that some videos may have a different lesson,
	  section or unit number. Please ignore this. In case the
	  content does not correspond to the title, please let us know.


This section has a technical overview of course followed by a broad
motivation for course.

The course overview covers it's content and structure. It presents an
introduction to general field of Big Data and Analytics. We are
especially analyzing the many different application areas in which Big
Data can be applied. As Big Datais typically not just used in
isolation but is part of a larger Informatics issue for a particular
field we also use the term X-Informatics, where X defines a use case or
area of specialization in which Big Data is applied to. As such we
organize the class around the the *Rallying Cry* of course: Use Clouds
running Data Analytics Collaboratively processing Big Data to solve
problems in X-Informatics.

The courses is set up as a number of lessons that are typically
between 20 minutes to an hour. The lessons are either provided as
written documents or as video lectures. They are enhanced by an in
person meeting that takes place either in a lecture room for
residential students or as online meeting for online students. 

The course covers a mix of applications (the X in X-Informatics) and
technologies needed to support the field electronically i.e. to
process the application data. The overview ends with a discussion of
course content at highest level. The course starts with a motivation
summarizing clouds and data science, then units describing
applications in areas such as Physics, e-Commerce, Web Search and Text
mining, Health, Sensors and Remote Sensing). These are interspersed
with discussions of infrastructure (clouds) and data analytics
(algorithms like clustering and collaborative filtering used in
applications). The course uses Python as primary programming language.
We will be introducing practical use of cloud resources so that you
have the opportunity to explore example analytics applications on
smaller data sets that you define.

The course motivation starts with striking examples of the data deluge
with examples from research, business and the consumer. The growing
number of jobs in data science is highlighted. He describes industry
trend in both clouds and big data. Then the cloud computing model
developed at amazing speed by industry is introduced. The 4 paradigms
of scientific research are described with growing importance of data
oriented version.He covers 3 major X-informatics areas: Physics,
e-Commerce and Web Search followed by a broad discussion of cloud
applications. Parallel computing in general and particular features of
MapReduce are described.

Emerging Technologies
"""""""""""""""""""""""

This presents the overview of talk, some trends in computing and data
and jobs. Gartner's emerging technology hype cycle shows many areas of
Clouds and Big Data. We highlight 6 issues of importance:
economic imperative, computing model, research model, Opportunities in
advancing computing, Opportunities in X-Informatics, Data Science
Education

Video: http://youtu.be/kyJxstTivoI


Data Deluge
"""""""""""""""""""""

We give some amazing statistics for total storage; uploaded
video and uploaded photos; the social media interactions every minute;
aspects of the business big data tidal wave; monitors of aircraft
engines; the science research data sizes from particle physics to
astronomy and earth science; genes sequenced; and finally the long
tail of science. The next slide emphasizes applications using
algorithms on clouds. This leads to the rallying cry "Use Clouds
running Data Analytics Collaboratively processing Big Data to solve
problems in X-Informatics educated in data science'' with a catalog of
the many values of X ''Astronomy, Biology, Biomedicine, Business,
Chemistry, Climate, Crisis, Earth Science, Energy, Environment,
Finance, Health, Intelligence, Lifestyle, Marketing, Medicine,
Pathology, Policy, Radar, Security, Sensor, Social, Sustainability,
Wealth and Wellness"

Video: http://youtu.be/sVNV0NxlQ6A



Jobs
"""""""""""""""

Jobs abound in clouds and data science. There are documented shortages
in data science, computer science and the major tech companies
advertise for new talent.

Video: http://youtu.be/h9u7YeKkHHU


Industrial Trends
"""""""""""""""""

Trends include the growing importance of mobile devices and
comparative decrease in desktop access, the export of internet
content, the change in dominant client operating systems, use of
social media, thriving Chinese internet companies.

Video: http://youtu.be/EIRIPDYN5nM

Digital Disruption of Old Favorites
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Not everything goes up. The rise of the Internet has led to declines
in some traditional areas including Shopping malls and Postal
Services.

Video: http://youtu.be/RxGopRuMWOE



Computing Model
""""""""""""""""

*Industry adopted clouds which are attractive for data analytics*

Clouds and Big Data are transformational on a 2-5 year time scale.
Already Amazon AWS is a lucrative business with almost a $4B revenue.
We describe the nature of cloud centers with economies of scale
and gives examples of importance of virtualization in server
consolidation. Then key characteristics of clouds are reviewed with
expected high growth in Infrastructure, Platform and Software as a
Service.

Video: http://youtu.be/NBZPQqXKbiw


Research Model
""""""""""""""

*4th Paradigm; From Theory to Data driven science?*

We introduce the 4 paradigms of scientific research with the
focus on the new fourth data driven methodology.

Video: http://youtu.be/2ke459BRBhw


Data Science Process
""""""""""""""""""""


We introduce the DIKW data to information to knowledge to
wisdom paradigm. Data flows through cloud services transforming itself
and emerging as new information to input into other transformations.

Video: http://youtu.be/j9ytOaBoe2k

Physics-Informatics
"""""""""""""""""""
*Looking for Higgs Particle with Large Hadron Collider LHC*

We look at important particle physics example where the Large
hadron Collider has observed the Higgs Boson. He shows this discovery
as a bump in a histogram; something that so amazed him 50 years ago
that he got a PhD in this field. He left field partly due to the
incredible size of author lists on papers.

Video: http://youtu.be/qUB0q4AOavY


Recommender Systems
"""""""""""""""""""

Many important applications involve matching users, web pages, jobs,
movies, books, events etc. These are all optimization problems with
recommender systems one important way of performing this optimization.
We go through the example of Netflix ~~ everything is a
recommendation and muses about the power of viewing all sorts of
things as items in a bag or more abstractly some space with funny
properties.

Video 1: http://youtu.be/Aj5k0Sa7XGQ
Video 2: http://youtu.be/VHS7il5OdjM



Web Search and Information Retrieval
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This course also looks at Web Search and here we give an
overview of the data analytics for web search, Pagerank as a method of
ranking web pages returned and uses material from Yahoo on the subtle
algorithms for dynamic personalized choice of material for web pages.

Video: http://youtu.be/i9gR9PdVXUU


Cloud Application in Research
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We describe scientific applications and how they map onto
clouds, supercomputers, grids and high throughput systems. He likes
the cloud use of the Internet of Things and gives examples.

Video: http://youtu.be/C19-5WQH2TU


Parallel Computing and MapReduce
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We define MapReduce and gives a homely example from fruit
blending.

Video: http://youtu.be/BbW1PFNnKrE


Data Science Education
""""""""""""""""""""""

We discuss one reason you are taking this course ~~ Data
Science as an educational initiative and aspects of its Indiana
University implementation. Then general; features of online education
are discussed with clear growth spearheaded by MOOC's where we
use this course and others as an example. He stresses the choice
between one class to 100,000 students or 2,000 classes to 50 students
and an online library of MOOC lessons. In olden days he suggested
''hermit's cage virtual university'' ~~ gurus in isolated caves
putting together exciting curricula outside the traditional university
model. Grading and mentoring models and important online tools are
discussed. Clouds have MOOC's describing them and MOOC's are stored in
clouds; a pleasing symmetry.

Video: http://youtu.be/x2LuiX8DYLs




Conclusions
"""""""""""

The conclusions highlight clouds, data-intensive methodology,
employment, data science, MOOC's and never forget the Big Data
ecosystem in one sentence "Use Clouds running Data Analytics
Collaboratively processing Big Data to solve problems in X-Informatics
educated in data science"

Overview of Data Science
------------------------

*What is Big Data, Data Analytics and X-Informatics?*


The course introduction starts with X-Informatics and its rallying
cry. The growing number of jobs in data science is highlighted. The
first unit offers a look at the phenomenon described as the Data
Deluge starting with its broad features. Data science and the famous
DIKW (Data to Information to Knowledge to Wisdom) pipeline are
covered. Then more detail is given on the flood of data from Internet
and Industry applications with eBay and General Electric discussed in
most detail.

In the next unit, we continue the discussion of the data deluge
with a focus on scientific research. He takes a first peek at data
from the Large Hadron Collider considered later as physics Informatics
and gives some biology examples. He discusses the implication of data
for the scientific method which is changing with the data-intensive
methodology joining observation, theory and simulation as basic
methods. Two broad classes of data are the long tail of sciences: many
users with individually modest data adding up to a lot; and a myriad
of Internet connected devices ~~ the Internet of Things.

We give an initial technical overview of cloud computing as
pioneered by companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft with new
centers holding up to a million servers. The benefits of Clouds in
terms of power consumption and the environment are also touched upon,
followed by a list of the most critical features of Cloud computing
with a comparison to supercomputing. Features of the data deluge are
discussed with a salutary example where more data did better than more
thought. Then comes Data science and one part of it ~~ data analytics
~~ the large algorithms that crunch the big data to give big wisdom.
There are many ways to describe data science and several are discussed
to give a good composite picture of this emerging field.



Data Science generics and Commercial Data Deluge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We start with X-Informatics and its rallying cry. The growing
number of jobs in data science is highlighted. This unit offers a look
at the phenomenon described as the Data Deluge starting with its broad
features. Then he discusses data science and the famous DIKW (Data to
Information to Knowledge to Wisdom) pipeline. Then more detail is
given on the flood of data from Internet and Industry applications
with eBay and General Electric discussed in most detail.

What is X-Informatics and its Motto
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This discusses trends that are driven by and accompany Big data. We
give some key terms including data, information, knowledge, wisdom,
data analytics and data science. WE introduce the motto of the course:
Use Clouds running Data Analytics Collaboratively processing Big Data
to solve problems in X-Informatics. We list many values of X you can
defined in various activities across the world.

Jobs
""""

Big data is especially important as there are some many related jobs.
We illustrate this for both cloud computing and data science from
reports by Microsoft and the McKinsey institute respectively. We show
a plot from LinkedIn showing rapid increase in the number of data
science and analytics jobs as a function of time.

Video: http://youtu.be/pRlfEigUJAc


Data Deluge: General Structure
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We look at some broad features of the data deluge starting with the
size of data in various areas especially in science research. We give
examples from real world of the importance of big data and illustrate
how it is integrated into an enterprise IT architecture. We give some
views as to what characterizes Big data and why data science is a
science that is needed to interpret all the data.

Video: http://youtu.be/mPJ9twAFRQU

Data Science: Process
"""""""""""""""""""""

We stress the DIKW pipeline: Data becomes information that becomes
knowledge and then wisdom, policy and decisions. This pipeline is
illustrated with Google maps and we show how complex the ecosystem of
data, transformations (filters) and its derived forms is.

Video: http://youtu.be/ydH34L-z0Rk



Data Deluge: Internet
"""""""""""""""""""""

We give examples of Big data from the Internet with Tweets, uploaded
photos and an illustration of the vitality and size of many commodity
applications.

Video: http://youtu.be/rtuq5y2Bx2g



Data Deluge: Business
"""""""""""""""""""""

We give examples including the Big data that enables wind farms, city
transportation, telephone operations, machines with health monitors,
the banking, manufacturing and retail industries both online and
offline in shopping malls. We give examples from ebay showing how
analytics allowing them to refine and improve the customer
experiences.

Data Deluge and Scientific Applications and Methodology
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Overview
""""""""


We continue the discussion of the data deluge with a focus on
scientific research. He takes a first peek at data from the Large
Hadron Collider considered later as physics Informatics and gives some
biology examples. He discusses the implication of data for the
scientific method which is changing with the data-intensive
methodology joining observation, theory and simulation as basic
methods. We discuss the long tail of sciences; many users with
individually modest data adding up to a lot. The last lesson
emphasizes how everyday devices ~~ the Internet of Things ~~ are being
used to create a wealth of data.



Slides: https://iu.box.com/s/e73lyv9sx7xcaqymb2n6



Science & Research
""""""""""""""""""

We look into more big data examples with a focus on science and
research. We give astronomy, genomics, radiology, particle physics and
discovery of Higgs particle (Covered in more detail in later lessons),
European Bioinformatics Institute and contrast to Facebook and
Walmart.

Video 1: http://youtu.be/u1h6bAkuWQ8

Video 2: http://youtu.be/_JfcUg2cheg


Implications for Scientific Method
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We discuss the emergences of a new fourth methodology for scientific
research based on data driven inquiry. We contrast this with third ~~
computation or simulation based discovery - methodology which emerged
itself some 25 years ago.

Video: http://youtu.be/srEbOAmU_g8



Long Tail of Science
""""""""""""""""""""

There is big science such as particle physics where a single
experiment has 3000 people collaborate!.Then there are individual
investigators who don't generate a lot of data each but together they
add up to Big data.

Video: http://youtu.be/dwzEKEGYhqE


Internet of Things
""""""""""""""""""

A final category of Big data comes from the Internet of Things where
lots of small devices ~~ smart phones, web cams, video games collect
and disseminate data and are controlled and coordinated in the cloud.

McKinsey Report on the big-data revolution in US health care
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This lesson covers 9 aspects of the McKinsey report. These are the
convergence of multiple positive changes has created a tipping point
for innovation; Primary data pools are at the heart of the big data
revolution in healthcare; Big data is changing the paradigm: these are
the value pathways; Applying early successes at scale could reduce US
healthcare costs by $300 billion to $450 billion; Most new big-data
applications target consumers and providers across pathways;
Innovations are weighted towards influencing individual
decision-making levers; Big data innovations use a range of public,
acquired, and proprietary data types; Organizations implementing a big
data transformation should provide the leadership required for the
associated cultural transformation; Companies must develop a range of
big data capabilities.

Genomics, Proteomics and Information Visualization I
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A study of an Azure application with an Excel frontend and a cloud
BLAST backend starts this lesson. This is followed by a big data
analysis of personal genomics and an analysis of a typical DNA
sequencing analytics pipeline. The Protein Sequence Universe is
defined and used to motivate Multi dimensional Scaling MDS. Sammon's
method is defined and its use illustrated by a metagenomics example.
Subtleties in use of MDS include a monotonic mapping of the
dissimilarity function. The application to the COG Proteomics dataset
is discussed. We note that the MDS approach is related to the well
known chisq method and some aspects of nonlinear minimization of chisq
(Least Squares) are discussed.

Video: http://youtu.be/r1yENstaAUE


Genomics, Proteomics and Information Visualization II
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This lesson continues the discussion of the COG Protein Universe
introduced in the last lesson. It is shown how Proteomics clusters are
clearly seen in the Universe browser. This motivates a side remark on
different clustering methods applied to metagenomics. Then we discuss
the Generative Topographic Map GTM method that can be used in
dimension reduction when original data is in a metric space and is in
this case faster than MDS as GTM computational complexity scales like
N not N squared as seen in MDS.

Examples are given of GTM including an application to topic models in
Information Retrieval. Indiana University has developed a
deterministic annealing improvement of GTM. 3 separate clusterings are
projected for visualization and show very different structure
emphasizing the importance of visualizing results of data analytics.
The final slide shows an application of MDS to generate and visualize
phylogenetic trees.

Unit Overview
"""""""""""""

This unit discusses baseball starting with the movie Moneyball and the
2002-2003 Oakland Athletics. Unlike sports like basketball and soccer,
most baseball action is built around individuals often interacting in
pairs. This is much easier to quantify than many player phenomena in
other sports. We discuss Performance-Dollar relationship including new
stadiums and media/advertising. We look at classic baseball averages
and sophisticated measures like Wins Above Replacement.

Section 6. Physics Case Study
----------------------------------------------------------------------


This section starts by describing the LHC accelerator at CERN and
evidence found by the experiments suggesting existence of a Higgs
Boson. The huge number of authors on a paper, remarks on histograms
and Feynman diagrams is followed by an accelerator picture
gallery. The next unit is devoted to Python experiments looking at
histograms of Higgs Boson production with various forms of shape of
signal and various background and with various event totals. Then
random variables and some simple principles of statistics are
introduced with explanation as to why they are relevant to Physics
counting experiments. The unit introduces Gaussian (normal)
distributions and explains why they seen so often in natural
phenomena. Several Python illustrations are given. Random Numbers with
their Generators and Seeds lead to a discussion of Binomial and
Poisson Distribution. Monte-Carlo and accept-reject methods. The
Central Limit Theorem concludes discussion.

Physics Use Case II 1: Class Software
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We discuss how this unit uses Java and Python on both a backend server
(FutureGrid) or a local client. WE point out useful book on Python for
data analysis. This builds on technology training in Section 3.

Physics Use Case II 2: Event Counting
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We define ''event counting'' data collection environments. We discuss
the python and Java code to generate events according to a particular
scenario (the important idea of Monte Carlo data). Here a sloping
background plus either a Higgs particle generated similarly to LHC
observation or one observed with better resolution (smaller
measurement error).

Physics Use Case II 3: With Python examples of Signal plus Background
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This uses Monte Carlo data both to generate data like the experimental
observations and explore effect of changing amount of data and
changing measurement resolution for Higgs.

Physics Use Case II 4: Change shape of background & num of Higgs Particles
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This lesson continues the examination of Monte Carlo data looking at
effect of change in number of Higgs particles produced and in change
in shape of background.

Looking for Higgs Particles: Random Variables, Physics and Normal Distributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We introduce random variables and some simple principles of
statistics and explains why they are relevant to Physics counting
experiments. The unit introduces Gaussian (normal) distributions and
explains why they seen so often in natural phenomena. Several Python
illustrations are given. Java is currently not available in this
unit.

Big Data Use Cases Survey
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This section covers 51 values of X and an overall study of Big data
that emerged from a NIST (National Institute for Standards and
Technology) study of Big data. The section covers the NIST Big Data
Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) Process and summarizes the work of five
subgroups: Definitions and Taxonomies Subgroup, Reference Architecture
Subgroup, Security and Privacy Subgroup, Technology Roadmap Subgroup
and the Requirements andUse Case Subgroup. 51 use cases collected in
this process are briefly discussed with a classification of the source
of parallelism and the high and low level computational structure. We
describe the key features of this classification.


Overview of NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) Process and Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This unit covers the NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG)
Process and summarizes the work of five subgroups: Definitions and
Taxonomies Subgroup, Reference Architecture Subgroup, Security and
Privacy Subgroup, Technology Roadmap Subgroup and the Requirements and
Use Case Subgroup. The work of latter is continued in next two units.

Introduction to NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) Process
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The focus of the (NBD-PWG) is to form a community of interest from
industry, academia, and government, with the goal of developing a
consensus definitions, taxonomies, secure reference architectures, and
technology roadmap. The aim is to create vendor-neutral, technology
and infrastructure agnostic deliverables to enable big data
stakeholders to pick-and-choose best analytics tools for their
processing and visualization requirements on the most suitable
computing platforms and clusters while allowing value-added from big
data service providers and flow of data between the stakeholders in a
cohesive and secure manner.

Video: http://youtu.be/ofRfHBKpyvg



Definitions and Taxonomies Subgroup
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The focus is to gain a better understanding of the principles of Big
Data. It is important to develop a consensus-based common language and
vocabulary terms used in Big Data across stakeholders from industry,
academia, and government. In addition, it is also critical to identify
essential actors with roles and responsibility, and subdivide them
into components and sub-components on how they interact/ relate with
each other according to their similarities and differences.

For Definitions: Compile terms used from all stakeholders regarding
the meaning of Big Data from various standard bodies, domain
applications, and diversified operational environments. For
Taxonomies: Identify key actors with their roles and responsibilities
from all stakeholders, categorize them into components and
subcomponents based on their similarities and differences. In
particular data Science and Big Data terms are discussed.

Video: http://youtu.be/sGshHN-DdbE

Reference Architecture Subgroup
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus-based approach
to orchestrate vendor-neutral, technology and infrastructure agnostic
for analytics tools and computing environments. The goal is to enable
Big Data stakeholders to pick-and-choose technology-agnostic analytics
tools for processing and visualization in any computing platform and
cluster while allowing value-added from Big Data service providers and
the flow of the data between the stakeholders in a cohesive and secure
manner. Results include a reference architecture with well defined
components and linkage as well as several exemplars.

Video: http://youtu.be/JV596ZH36YA


Security and Privacy Subgroup
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus secure
reference architecture to handle security and privacy issues across
all stakeholders. This includes gaining an understanding of what
standards are available or under development, as well as identifies
which key organizations are working on these standards. The Top Ten
Big Data Security and Privacy Challenges from the CSA (Cloud Security
Alliance) BDWG are studied. Specialized use cases include
Retail/Marketing, Modern Day Consumerism, Nielsen Homescan, Web
Traffic Analysis, Healthcare, Health Information Exchange, Genetic
Privacy, Pharma Clinical Trial Data Sharing, Cyber-security,
Government, Military and Education.

Video: http://youtu.be/Gbk0LaWE3lM

Technology Roadmap Subgroup
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus vision with
recommendations on how Big Data should move forward by performing a
good gap analysis through the materials gathered from all other NBD
subgroups. This includes setting standardization and adoption
priorities through an understanding of what standards are available or
under development as part of the recommendations. Tasks are gather
input from NBD subgroups and study the taxonomies for the actors'
roles and responsibility, use cases and requirements, and secure
reference architecture; gain understanding of what standards are
available or under development for Big Data; perform a thorough gap
analysis and document the findings; identify what possible barriers
may delay or prevent adoption of Big Data; and document vision and
recommendations.

Requirements and Use Case Subgroup Introduction I
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""


The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus list of Big
Data requirements across all stakeholders. This includes gathering and
understanding various use cases from diversified application
domains.Tasks are gather use case input from all stakeholders; derive
Big Data requirements from each use case; analyze/prioritize a list of
challenging general requirements that may delay or prevent adoption of
Big Data deployment; develop a set of general patterns capturing the
''essence'' of use cases (not done yet) and work with Reference
Architecture to validate requirements and reference architecture by
explicitly implementing some patterns based on use cases. The progress
of gathering use cases (discussed in next two units) and requirements
systemization are discussed.

Technology Training - Plotviz
-----------------------------

We introduce Plotviz, a data visualization tool developed at
Indiana University to display 2 and 3 dimensional data. The motivation
is that the human eye is very good at pattern recognition and can
''see'' structure in data. Although most Big data is higher
dimensional than 3, all can be transformed by dimension reduction
techniques to 3D. He gives several examples to show how the software
can be used and what kind of data can be visualized. This includes
individual plots and the manipulation of multiple synchronized
plots.Finally, he describes the download and software dependency of
Plotviz.

Motivation and Introduction to use
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The motivation of Plotviz is that the human eye is very good at
pattern recognition and can ''see'' structure in data. Although most
Big data is higher dimensional than 3, all data can be transformed by
dimension reduction techniques to 3D and one can check analysis like
clustering and/or see structure missed in a computer analysis. The
motivations shows some Cheminformatics examples. The use of Plotviz is
started in slide 4 with a discussion of input file which is either a
simple text or more features (like colors) can be specified in a rich
XML syntax. Plotviz deals with points and their classification
(clustering). Next the protein sequence browser in 3D shows the basic
structure of Plotviz interface. The next two slides explain the core
3D and 2D manipulations respectively. Note all files used in examples
are available to students.

Video: http://youtu.be/4aQlCmQ1jfY



Example of Use I: Cube and Structured Dataset
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Initially we start with a simple plot of 8 points -- the corners of a
cube in 3 dimensions -- showing basic operations such as
size/color/labels and Legend of points. The second example shows a
dataset (coming from GTM dimension reduction) with significant
structure. This has .pviz and a .txt versions that are compared.

Video: http://youtu.be/nCTT5mI_j_Q


Example of Use II: Proteomics and Synchronized Rotation
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This starts with an examination of a sample of Protein Universe
Browser showing how one uses Plotviz to look at different features of
this set of Protein sequences projected to 3D. Then we show how to
compare two datasets with synchronized rotation of a dataset clustered
in 2 different ways; this dataset comes from k Nearest Neighbor
discussion.

Video: http://youtu.be/lDbIhnLrNkk



Example of Use III: More Features and larger Proteomics Sample
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This starts by describing use of Labels and Glyphs and the Default
mode in Plotviz. Then we illustrate sophisticated use of these ideas
to view a large Proteomics dataset.

Video: http://youtu.be/KBkUW_QNSvs


Example of Use IV: Tools and Examples
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This lesson starts by describing the Plotviz tools and then sets up
two examples -- Oil Flow and Trading -- described in PowerPoint. It
finishes with the Plotviz viewing of Oil Flow data.

Video: http://youtu.be/zp_709imR40


Example of Use V: Final Examples
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This starts with Plotviz looking at Trading example introduced in
previous lesson and then examines solvent data. It finishes with two
large biology examples with 446K and 100K points and each with over
100 clusters. We finish remarks on Plotviz software structure and how
to download. We also remind you that a picture is worth a 1000 words.

e-Commerce and LifeStyle Case Study
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Recommender systems operate under the hood of such widely recognized
sites as Amazon, eBay, Monster and Netflix where everything is a
recommendation. This involves a symbiotic relationship between vendor
and buyer whereby the buyer provides the vendor with information about
their preferences, while the vendor then offers recommendations
tailored to match their needs. Kaggle competitions h improve the
success of the Netflix and other recommender systems. Attention is
paid to models that are used to compare how changes to the systems
affect their overall performance. It is interesting that the humble
ranking has become such a dominant driver of the world's economy. More
examples of recommender systems are given from Google News, Retail
stores and in depth Yahoo! covering the multi-faceted criteria used in
deciding recommendations on web sites.

The formulation of recommendations in terms of points in a space or
bag is given where bags of item properties, user properties, rankings
and users are useful. Detail is given on basic principles behind
recommender systems: user-based collaborative filtering, which uses
similarities in user rankings to predict their interests, and the
Pearson correlation, used to statistically quantify correlations
between users viewed as points in a space of items. Items are viewed
as points in a space of users in item-based collaborative
filtering. The Cosine Similarity is introduced, the difference between
implicit and explicit ratings and the k Nearest Neighbors
algorithm. General features like the curse of dimensionality in high
dimensions are discussed. A simple Python k Nearest Neighbor code and
its application to an artificial data set in 3 dimensions is
given. Results are visualized in Matplotlib in 2D and with Plotviz in
3D. The concept of a training and a testing set are introduced with
training set pre labeled. Recommender system are used to discuss
clustering with k-means based clustering methods used and their
results examined in Plotviz. The original labelling is compared to
clustering results and extension to 28 clusters given. General issues
in clustering are discussed including local optima, the use of
annealing to avoid this and value of heuristic algorithms.

We introduce Recommender systems as an optimization technology
used in a variety of applications and contexts online. They operate in
the background of such widely recognized sites as Amazon, eBay,
Monster and Netflix where everything is a recommendation. This
involves a symbiotic relationship between vendor and buyer whereby the
buyer provides the vendor with information about their preferences,
while the vendor then offers recommendations tailored to match their
needs, to the benefit of both.

There follows an exploration of the Kaggle competition site, other
recommender systems and Netflix, as well as competitions held to
improve the success of the Netflix recommender system. Finally
attention is paid to models that are used to compare how changes to
the systems affect their overall performance. It is interesting how the
humble ranking has become such a dominant driver of the world's
economy.

Recommender Systems as an Optimization Problem
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We define a set of general recommender systems as matching of items to
people or perhaps collections of items to collections of people where
items can be other people, products in a store, movies, jobs, events,
web pages etc. We present this as "yet another optimization problem".

Recommender Systems Introduction
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We give a general discussion of recommender systems and point out that
they are particularly valuable in long tail of tems (to be
recommended) that aren't commonly known. We pose them as a rating
system and relate them to information retrieval rating systems. We can
contrast recommender systems based on user profile and context; the
most familiar collaborative filtering of others ranking; item
properties; knowledge and hybrid cases mixing some or all of these.

https://youtu.be/KbjBKrzFYKg


Kaggle Competitions
"""""""""""""""""""

We look at Kaggle competitions with examples from web site. In
particular we discuss an Irvine class project involving ranking jokes.

https://youtu.be/DFH7GPrbsJA



Examples of Recommender Systems
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""


We go through a list of 9 recommender systems from the same Irvine
class.

Netflix on Recommender Systems I
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This is Part 1.

We summarize some interesting points from a tutorial from Netflix for
whom ''everything is a recommendation''. Rankings are given in
multiple categories and categories that reflect user interests are
especially important. Criteria used include explicit user preferences,
implicit based on ratings and hybrid methods as well as freshness and
diversity. Netflix tries to explain the rationale of its
recommendations. We give some data on Netflix operations and some
methods used in its recommender systems. We describe the famous
Netflix Kaggle competition to improve its rating system. The analogy
to maximizing click through rate is given and the objectives of
optimization are given.

Consumer Data Science
"""""""""""""""""""""

Here we go through Netflix's methodology in letting data speak for
itself in optimizing the recommender engine. An example iis given on
choosing self produced movies. A/B testing is discussed with examples
showing how testing does allow optimizing of sophisticated
criteria. This lesson is concluded by comments on Netflix technology
and the full spectrum of issues that are involved including user
interface, data, AB testing, systems and architectures. We comment on
optimizing for a household rather than optimizing for individuals in
household.

Recommender Systems: Examples and Algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We continue the discussion of recommender systems and their use in
e-commerce. More examples are given from Google News, Retail stores
and in depth Yahoo! covering the multi-faceted criteria used in
deciding recommendations on web sites. Then the formulation of
recommendations in terms of points in a space or bag is given.

Here bags of item properties, user properties, rankings and users are
useful. Then we go into detail on basic principles behind recommender
systems: user-based collaborative filtering, which uses similarities
in user rankings to predict their interests, and the Pearson
correlation, used to statistically quantify correlations between users
viewed as points in a space of items.

Recap and Examples of Recommender Systems
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We start with a quick recap of recommender systems from previous unit;
what they are with brief examples.

We give 2 examples in more detail: namely Google News and Markdown in
Retail.

Recommender Systems in Yahoo Use Case Example I
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We describe in greatest detail the methods used to optimize Yahoo web
sites. There are two lessons discussing general approach and a third
lesson examines a particular personalized Yahoo page with its
different components. We point out the different criteria that must be
blended in making decisions; these criteria include analysis of what
user does after a particular page is clicked; is the user satisfied
and cannot that we quantified by purchase decisions etc. We need to
choose Articles, ads, modules, movies, users, updates, etc to optimize
metrics such as relevance score, CTR, revenue, engagement.These lesson
stress that if though we have big data, the recommender data is
sparse. We discuss the approach that involves both batch (offline) and
on-line (real time) components.

User-based nearest-neighbor collaborative filtering I
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Collaborative filtering is a core approach to recommender
systems. There is user-based and item-based collaborative filtering
and here we discuss the user-based case. Here similarities in user
rankings allow one to predict their interests, and typically this
quantified by the Pearson correlation, used to statistically quantify
correlations between users.

Vector Space Formulation of Recommender Systems
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We go through recommender systems thinking of them as formulated in a
funny vector space. This suggests using clustering to make
recommendations.

Unit 22. Item-based Collaborative Filtering and its Technologies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We move on to item-based collaborative filtering where items
are viewed as points in a space of users. The Cosine Similarity is
introduced, the difference between implicit and explicit ratings and
the k Nearest Neighbors algorithm. General features like the curse of
dimensionality in high dimensions are discussed.


Slides: https://iu.app.box.com/s/fvrwds7zd65m79a7uur3


Item-based Collaborative Filtering I
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We covered user-based collaborative filtering in the previous
unit. Here we start by discussing memory-based real time and model
based offline (batch) approaches. Now we look at item-based
collaborative filtering where items are viewed in the space of users
and the cosine measure is used to quantify distances. WE discuss
optimizations and how batch processing can help. We discuss different
Likert ranking scales and issues with new items that do not have a
significant number of rankings.

k Nearest Neighbors and High Dimensional Spaces
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We define the k Nearest Neighbor algorithms and present the Python
software but do not use it. We give examples from Wikipedia and
describe performance issues. This algorithm illustrates the curse of
dimensionality. If items were a real vectors in a low dimension space,
there would be faster solution methods.

Technology Training - kNN & Clustering
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This section is meant to provide a discussion on the kth Nearest
Neighbor (kNN) algorithm and clustering using K-means. Python version
for kNN is discussed in the video and instructions for both Java and
Python are mentioned in the slides. Plotviz is used for generating 3D
visualizations.


Recommender Systems - K-Nearest Neighbors (Python & Java Track)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We discuss simple Python k Nearest Neighbor code and its
application to an artificial data set in 3 dimensions. Results are
visualized in Matplotlib in 2D and with Plotviz in 3D. The concept of
training and testing sets are introduced with training set
pre-labelled.

Python k'th Nearest Neighbor Algorithms I
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This lesson considers the Python k Nearest Neighbor code found on the
web associated with a book by Harrington on Machine Learning. There
are two data sets. First we consider a set of 4 2D vectors divided
into two categories (clusters) and use k=3 Nearest Neighbor algorithm
to classify 3 test points. Second we consider a 3D dataset that has
already been classified and show how to normalize. In this lesson we
just use Matplotlib to give 2D plots.

Video 1: https://youtu.be/o16L0EqsQ_g

Video 2: https://youtu.be/JK5p24mnTjs


3D Visualization
""""""""""""""""

The lesson modifies the online code to allow it to produce files
readable by PlotViz. We visualize already classified 3D set and rotate
in 3D.

https://youtu.be/fLtH-ZI1Jqk


Testing k'th Nearest Neighbor Algorithms
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The lesson goes through an example of using k NN classification
algorithm by dividing dataset into 2 subsets. One is training set with
initial classification; the other is test point to be classified by
k=3 NN using training set. The code records fraction of points with a
different classification from that input. One can experiment with
different sizes of the two subsets. The Python implementation of
algorithm is analyzed in detail.

https://youtu.be/zLaPGMIQ9So

Clustering and heuristic methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We use example of recommender system to discuss clustering. The
details of methods are not discussed but k-means based clustering
methods are used and their results examined in Plotviz. The original
labelling is compared to clustering results and extension to 28
clusters given. General issues in clustering are discussed including
local optima, the use of annealing to avoid this and value of
heuristic algorithms.

Kmeans Clustering
"""""""""""""""""

We introduce the k means algorithm in a gentle fashion and
describes its key features including dangers of local minima. A simple
example from Wikipedia is examined.

https://youtu.be/3KTNJ0Okrqs


Clustering of Recommender System Example
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Plotviz is used to examine and compare the original classification
with an ''optimal'' clustering into 3 clusters using a fancy
deterministic annealing method that is similar to k means. The new
clustering has centers marked.

https://youtu.be/yl_KZ86NT-A


Clustering of Recommender Example into more than 3 Clusters
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The previous division into 3 clusters is compared into a clustering
into 28 separate clusters that are naturally smaller in size and
divide 3D space covered by 1000 points into compact geometrically
local regions.

https://youtu.be/JWZmh48l0cw



Local Optima in Clustering
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This lesson introduces some general principles. First many important
processes are ''just'' optimization problems. Most such problems are
rife with local optima. The key idea behind annealing to avoid local
optima is described. The pervasive greedy optimization method is
described.

https://youtu.be/Zmq8O_axCmc


Clustering in General
"""""""""""""""""""""

The two different applications of clustering are described. First find
geometrically distinct regions and secondly divide spaces into
geometrically compact regions that may have no ''thin air'' between
them. Generalizations such as mixture models and latent factor methods
are just mentioned. The important distinction between applications in
vector spaces and those where only inter-point distances are defined
is described. Examples are then given using PlotViz from 2D clustering
of a mass spectrometry example and the results of clustering genomic
data mapped into 3D with Multi Dimensional Scaling MDS.

https://youtu.be/JejNZhBxjRU



Heuristics
""""""""""

Some remarks are given on heuristics; why are they so important why
getting exact answers is often not so important?

Cloud Computing Technology for Big Data Applications & Analytics (will be updated)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We describe the central role of Parallel computing in Clouds and Big
Data which is decomposed into lots of ''Little data'' running in
individual cores. Many examples are given and it is stressed that
issues in parallel computing are seen in day to day life for
communication, synchronization, load balancing and
decomposition. Cyberinfrastructure for e-moreorlessanything or
moreorlessanything-Informatics and the basics of cloud computing are
introduced. This includes virtualization and the important ''as a
Service'' components and we go through several different definitions
of cloud computing.

Gartner's Technology Landscape includes hype cycle and priority matrix
and covers clouds and Big Data. Two simple examples of the value of
clouds for enterprise applications are given with a review of
different views as to nature of Cloud Computing. This IaaS
(Infrastructure as a Service) discussion is followed by PaaS and SaaS
(Platform and Software as a Service). Features in Grid and cloud
computing and data are treated. We summarize the 21 layers and almost
300 software packages in the HPC-ABDS Software Stack explaining how
they are used.

Cloud (Data Center) Architectures with physical setup, Green Computing
issues and software models are discussed followed by the Cloud
Industry stakeholders with a 2014 Gartner analysis of Cloud computing
providers. This is followed by applications on the cloud including
data intensive problems, comparison with high performance computing,
science clouds and the Internet of Things. Remarks on Security, Fault
Tolerance and Synchronicity issues in cloud follow. We describe the
way users and data interact with a cloud system. The Big Data
Processing from an application perspective with commercial examples
including eBay concludes section after a discussion of data system
architectures.




Parallel Computing: Overview of Basic Principles with familiar Examples

Decomposition 
"""""""""""""""

We describe why parallel computing is essential with Big Data
and distinguishes parallelism over users to that over the data in
problem. The general ideas behind data decomposition are given
followed by a few often whimsical examples dreamed up 30 years ago in
the early heady days of parallel computing. These include scientific
simulations, defense outside missile attack and computer chess. The
basic problem of parallel computing -- efficient coordination of
separate tasks processing different data parts -- is described with
MPI and MapReduce as two approaches. The challenges of data
decomposition in irregular problems is noted.

Parallel Computing in Society 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This lesson from the past notes that one can view society as an
approach to parallel linkage of people. The largest example given is
that of the construction of a long wall such as that (Hadrian's wall)
between England and Scotland. Different approaches to parallelism are
given with formulae for the speed up and efficiency. The concepts of
grain size (size of problem tackled by an individual processor) and
coordination overhead are exemplified. This example also illustrates
Amdahl's law and the relation between data and processor topology. The
lesson concludes with other examples from nature including collections
of neurons (the brain) and ants.

Parallel Processing for Hadrian's Wall
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This lesson returns to Hadrian's wall and uses it to illustrate
advanced issues in parallel computing. First We describe the
basic SPMD -- Single Program Multiple Data -- model. Then irregular
but homogeneous and heterogeneous problems are discussed. Static and
dynamic load balancing is needed. Inner parallelism (as in vector
instruction or the multiple fingers of masons) and outer parallelism
(typical data parallelism) are demonstrated. Parallel I/O for
Hadrian's wall is followed by a slide summarizing this quaint
comparison between Big data parallelism and the construction of a
large wall.

search engines and the relation to the field of Information
Retrieval. The importance of recall, precision and diversity is
discussed. The important Bag of Words model is introduced and both
Boolean queries and the more general fuzzy indices. The important
vector space model and revisiting the Cosine Similarity as a distance
in this bag follows. The basic TF-IDF approach is dis
cussed. Relevance is discussed with a probabilistic model while the
distinction between Bayesian and frequency views of probability
distribution completes this unit.

Technology for Big Data Applications and Analytics
----------------------------------------------------------------------

We use the K-means Python code in SciPy package to show real
code for clustering. After a simple example we generate 4 clusters of
distinct centers and various choice for sizes using Matplotlib tor
visualization. We show results can sometimes be incorrect and
sometimes make different choices among comparable solutions. We
discuss the ''hill'' between different solutions and rationale for
running K-means many times and choosing best answer. Then we introduce
MapReduce with the basic architecture and a homely example. The
discussion of advanced topics includes an extension to Iterative
MapReduce from Indiana University called Twister and a generalized Map
Collective model. Some measurements of parallel performance are
given. The SciPy K-means code is modified to support a MapReduce
execution style. This illustrates the key ideas of mappers and
reducers. With appropriate runtime this code would run in parallel but
here the ''parallel'' maps run sequentially. This simple 2 map version
can be generalized to scalable parallelism. Python is used to
Calculate PageRank from Web Linkage Matrix showing several different
formulations of the basic matrix equations to finding leading
eigenvector. The unit is concluded by a calculation of PageRank for
general web pages by extracting the secret from Google.

We use the K-means Python code in SciPy package to show real
code for clustering and applies it a set of 85 two dimensional vectors
-- officially sets of weights and heights to be clustered to find
T-shirt sizes. We run through Python code with Matplotlib displays to
divide into 2-5 clusters. Then we discuss Python to generate 4
clusters of varying sizes and centered at corners of a square in two
dimensions. We formally give the K means algorithm better than before
and make definition consistent with code in SciPy.

Analysis of 4 Artificial Clusters I
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We present clustering results on the artificial set of 1000 2D points
described in previous lesson for 3 choices of cluster sizes ''small''
''large'' and ''very large''. We emphasize the SciPy always does 20
independent K means and takes the best result -- an approach to
avoiding local minima. We allow this number of independent runs to be
changed and in particular set to 1 to generate more interesting
erratic results. We define changes in our new K means code that also
has two measures of quality allowed. The slides give many results of
clustering into 2 4 6 and 8 clusters (there were only 4 real
clusters). We show that the ''very small'' case has two very different
solutions when clustered into two clusters and use this to discuss
functions with multiple minima and a hill between them. The lesson has
both discussion of already produced results in slides and interactive
use of Python for new runs.

We start with the Internet of Things IoT giving examples like
monitors of machine operation, QR codes, surveillance cameras,
scientific sensors, drones and self driving cars and more generally
transportation systems. We give examples of robots and drones. We
introduce the Industrial Internet of Things IIoT and summarize surveys
and expectations Industry wide. We give examples from General
Electric. Sensor clouds control the many small distributed devices of
IoT and IIoT. More detail is given for radar data gathered by sensors;
ubiquitous or smart cities and homes including U-Korea; and finally
the smart electric grid.


Slides: https://iu.box.com/s/9a5y7p7xvhjqgrc9zjob8gorv3ft4kyq


Internet of Things
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are predicted to be 24-50 Billion devices on the Internet by
2020; these are typically some sort of sensor defined as any source or
sink of time series data. Sensors include smartphones, webcams,
monitors of machine operation, barcodes, surveillance cameras,
scientific sensors (especially in earth and environmental science),
drones and self driving cars and more generally transportation
systems. The lesson gives many examples of distributed sensors, which
form a Grid that is controlled by a cloud.

U-Korea (U=Ubiquitous)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Korea has an interesting positioning where it is first worldwide in
broadband access per capita, e-government, scientific literacy and
total working hours. However it is far down in measures like quality
of life and GDP. U-Korea aims to improve the latter by Pervasive
computing, everywhere, anytime i.e. by spreading sensors
everywhere. The example of a 'High-Tech Utopia' New Songdo is given.

https://youtu.be/wdot23r4YKs


Smart Grid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The electrical Smart Grid aims to enhance USA's aging electrical
infrastructure by pervasive deployment of sensors and the integration
of their measurement in a cloud or equivalent server infrastructure. A
variety of new instruments include smart meters, power monitors, and
measures of solar irradiance, wind speed, and temperature. One goal is
autonomous local power units where good use is made of waste heat.

Radar Case Study
----------------

The changing global climate is suspected to have long-term effects on
much of the world's inhabitants. Among the various effects, the rising
sea level will directly affect many people living in low-lying coastal
regions. While the ocean-s thermal expansion has been the dominant
contributor to rises in sea level, the potential contribution of
discharges from the polar ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica may
provide a more significant threat due to the unpredictable response to
the changing climate. The Radar-Informatics unit provides a glimpse in
the processes fueling global climate change and explains what methods
are used for ice data acquisitions and analysis.


Slides: https://iu.app.box.com/s/njxktkb71e2cbroopsx2


Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This lesson motivates radar-informatics by building on previous
discussions on why X-applications are growing in data size and why
analytics are necessary for acquiring knowledge from large data. The
lesson details three mosaics of a changing Greenland ice sheet and
provides a concise overview to subsequent lessons by detailing
explaining how other remote sensing technologies, such as the radar,
can be used to sound the polar ice sheets and what we are doing with
radar images to extract knowledge to be incorporated into numerical
models.

https://youtu.be/LXOncC2AhsI


Remote Sensing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This lesson explains the basics of remote sensing, the characteristics
of remote sensors and remote sensing applications. Emphasis is on
image acquisition and data collection in the electromagnetic spectrum.

https://youtu.be/TTrm9rmZySQ


Ice Sheet Science
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


This lesson provides a brief understanding on why melt water at the
base of the ice sheet can be detrimental and why it’s important for
sensors to sound the bedrock.

https://youtu.be/rDpjMLguVBc


Global Climate Change
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This lesson provides an understanding and the processes for the
greenhouse effect, how warming effects the Polar Regions, and the
implications of a rise in sea level.

https://youtu.be/f9hzzJX0qDs



Radio Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This lesson provides an elementary introduction to radar and its
importance to remote sensing, especially to acquiring information
about Greenland and Antarctica.

https://youtu.be/PuI7F-RMKCI



Radio Informatics
