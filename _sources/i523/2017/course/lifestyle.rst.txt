e-Commerce and LifeStyle Case Study
-----------------------------------

Recommender systems operate under the hood of such widely recognized
sites as Amazon, eBay, Monster and Netflix where everything is a
recommendation. This involves a symbiotic relationship between vendor
and buyer whereby the buyer provides the vendor with information about
their preferences, while the vendor then offers recommendations
tailored to match their needs. Kaggle competitions h improve the
success of the Netflix and other recommender systems. Attention is
paid to models that are used to compare how changes to the systems
affect their overall performance. It is interesting that the humble
ranking has become such a dominant driver of the world's economy. More
examples of recommender systems are given from Google News, Retail
stores and in depth Yahoo! covering the multi-faceted criteria used in
deciding recommendations on web sites.

The formulation of recommendations in terms of points in a space or
bag is given where bags of item properties, user properties, rankings
and users are useful. Detail is given on basic principles behind
recommender systems: user-based collaborative filtering, which uses
similarities in user rankings to predict their interests, and the
Pearson correlation, used to statistically quantify correlations
between users viewed as points in a space of items. Items are viewed
as points in a space of users in item-based collaborative
filtering. The Cosine Similarity is introduced, the difference between
implicit and explicit ratings and the k Nearest Neighbors
algorithm. General features like the curse of dimensionality in high
dimensions are discussed. A simple Python k Nearest Neighbor code and
its application to an artificial data set in 3 dimensions is
given. Results are visualized in Matplotlib in 2D and with Plotviz in
3D. The concept of a training and a testing set are introduced with
training set pre labeled. Recommender system are used to discuss
clustering with k-means based clustering methods used and their
results examined in Plotviz. The original labelling is compared to
clustering results and extension to 28 clusters given. General issues
in clustering are discussed including local optima, the use of
annealing to avoid this and value of heuristic algorithms.





Recommender Systems: Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We introduce Recommender systems as an optimization technology
used in a variety of applications and contexts online. They operate in
the background of such widely recognized sites as Amazon, eBay,
Monster and Netflix where everything is a recommendation. This
involves a symbiotic relationship between vendor and buyer whereby the
buyer provides the vendor with information about their preferences,
while the vendor then offers recommendations tailored to match their
needs, to the benefit of both.

There follows an exploration of the Kaggle competition site, other
recommender systems and Netflix, as well as competitions held to
improve the success of the Netflix recommender system. Finally
attention is paid to models that are used to compare how changes to
the systems affect their overall performance. It is interesting how the
humble ranking has become such a dominant driver of the world's
economy.

Recommender Systems as an Optimization Problem
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We define a set of general recommender systems as matching of items to
people or perhaps collections of items to collections of people where
items can be other people, products in a store, movies, jobs, events,
web pages etc. We present this as "yet another optimization problem".

Recommender Systems Introduction
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We give a general discussion of recommender systems and point out that
they are particularly valuable in long tail of tems (to be
recommended) that aren't commonly known. We pose them as a rating
system and relate them to information retrieval rating systems. We can
contrast recommender systems based on user profile and context; the
most familiar collaborative filtering of others ranking; item
properties; knowledge and hybrid cases mixing some or all of these.

Kaggle Competitions
"""""""""""""""""""

We look at Kaggle competitions with examples from web site. In
particular we discuss an Irvine class project involving ranking jokes.

* Video: 3:36: Kaggle Competitions: https://youtu.be/DFH7GPrbsJA



Examples of Recommender Systems
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""


We go through a list of 9 recommender systems from the same Irvine
class.

Netflix on Recommender Systems
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This is Part 1.

We summarize some interesting points from a tutorial from Netflix for
whom ''everything is a recommendation''. Rankings are given in
multiple categories and categories that reflect user interests are
especially important. Criteria used include explicit user preferences,
implicit based on ratings and hybrid methods as well as freshness and
diversity. Netflix tries to explain the rationale of its
recommendations. We give some data on Netflix operations and some
methods used in its recommender systems. We describe the famous
Netflix Kaggle competition to improve its rating system. The analogy
to maximizing click through rate is given and the objectives of
optimization are given.

Consumer Data Science
"""""""""""""""""""""

Here we go through Netflix's methodology in letting data speak for
itself in optimizing the recommender engine. An example iis given on
choosing self produced movies. A/B testing is discussed with examples
showing how testing does allow optimizing of sophisticated
criteria. This lesson is concluded by comments on Netflix technology
and the full spectrum of issues that are involved including user
interface, data, AB testing, systems and architectures. We comment on
optimizing for a household rather than optimizing for individuals in
household.

Recommender Systems: Examples and Algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We continue the discussion of recommender systems and their use in
e-commerce. More examples are given from Google News, Retail stores
and in depth Yahoo! covering the multi-faceted criteria used in
deciding recommendations on web sites. Then the formulation of
recommendations in terms of points in a space or bag is given.

Here bags of item properties, user properties, rankings and users are
useful. Then we go into detail on basic principles behind recommender
systems: user-based collaborative filtering, which uses similarities
in user rankings to predict their interests, and the Pearson
correlation, used to statistically quantify correlations between users
viewed as points in a space of items.

Recap and Examples of Recommender Systems
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We start with a quick recap of recommender systems from previous unit;
what they are with brief examples.

We give 2 examples in more detail: namely Google News and Markdown in
Retail.

Recommender Systems in Yahoo Use Case Example
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We describe in greatest detail the methods used to optimize Yahoo web
sites. There are two lessons discussing general approach and a third
lesson examines a particular personalized Yahoo page with its
different components. We point out the different criteria that must be
blended in making decisions; these criteria include analysis of what
user does after a particular page is clicked; is the user satisfied
and cannot that we quantified by purchase decisions etc. We need to
choose Articles, ads, modules, movies, users, updates, etc to optimize
metrics such as relevance score, CTR, revenue, engagement.These lesson
stress that if though we have big data, the recommender data is
sparse. We discuss the approach that involves both batch (offline) and
on-line (real time) components.

User-based nearest-neighbor collaborative filtering
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Collaborative filtering is a core approach to recommender
systems. There is user-based and item-based collaborative filtering
and here we discuss the user-based case. Here similarities in user
rankings allow one to predict their interests, and typically this
quantified by the Pearson correlation, used to statistically quantify
correlations between users.

Vector Space Formulation of Recommender Systems
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We go through recommender systems thinking of them as formulated in a
funny vector space. This suggests using clustering to make
recommendations.

Item-based Collaborative Filtering and its Technologies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We move on to item-based collaborative filtering where items
are viewed as points in a space of users. The Cosine Similarity is
introduced, the difference between implicit and explicit ratings and
the k Nearest Neighbors algorithm. General features like the curse of
dimensionality in high dimensions are discussed.

Item-based Collaborative Filtering
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We covered user-based collaborative filtering in the previous
unit. Here we start by discussing memory-based real time and model
based offline (batch) approaches. Now we look at item-based
collaborative filtering where items are viewed in the space of users
and the cosine measure is used to quantify distances. WE discuss
optimizations and how batch processing can help. We discuss different
Likert ranking scales and issues with new items that do not have a
significant number of rankings.

k Nearest Neighbors and High Dimensional Spaces
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We define the k Nearest Neighbor algorithms and present the Python
software but do not use it. We give examples from Wikipedia and
describe performance issues. This algorithm illustrates the curse of
dimensionality. If items were a real vectors in a low dimension space,
there would be faster solution methods.
