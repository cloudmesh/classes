Sensors Case Study
------------------

We start with the Internet of Things IoT giving examples like
monitors of machine operation, QR codes, surveillance cameras,
scientific sensors, drones and self driving cars and more generally
transportation systems. We give examples of robots and drones. We
introduce the Industrial Internet of Things IIoT and summarize surveys
and expectations Industry wide. We give examples from General
Electric. Sensor clouds control the many small distributed devices of
IoT and IIoT. More detail is given for radar data gathered by sensors;
ubiquitous or smart cities and homes including U-Korea; and finally
the smart electric grid.

Internet of Things
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are predicted to be 24-50 Billion devices on the Internet by
2020; these are typically some sort of sensor defined as any source or
sink of time series data. Sensors include smartphones, webcams,
monitors of machine operation, barcodes, surveillance cameras,
scientific sensors (especially in earth and environmental science),
drones and self driving cars and more generally transportation
systems. The lesson gives many examples of distributed sensors, which
form a Grid that is controlled by a cloud.

Robotics and IOT Expectations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Examples of Robots and Drones.

Industrial Internet of Things
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We summarize surveys and expectations Industry wide.

Sensor Clouds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We describe the architecture of a Sensor Cloud control
environment and gives example of interface to an older version of
it. The performance of system is measured in terms of processing
latency as a function of number of involved sensors with each
delivering data at 1.8 Mbps rate.

Earth/Environment/Polar Science data gathered by Sensors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This lesson gives examples of some sensors in the
Earth/Environment/Polar Science field. It starts with material from
the CReSIS polar remote sensing project and then looks at the NSF
Ocean Observing Initiative and NASA's MODIS or Moderate Resolution
Imaging Spectroradiometer instrument on a satellite.

Ubiquitous/Smart Cities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For Ubiquitous/Smart cities we give two examples: Iniquitous Korea and
smart electrical grids.

U-Korea (U=Ubiquitous)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Korea has an interesting positioning where it is first worldwide in
broadband access per capita, e-government, scientific literacy and
total working hours. However it is far down in measures like quality
of life and GDP. U-Korea aims to improve the latter by Pervasive
computing, everywhere, anytime i.e. by spreading sensors
everywhere. The example of a 'High-Tech Utopia' New Songdo is given.

Smart Grid
^^^^^^^^^^

The electrical Smart Grid aims to enhance USA's aging electrical
infrastructure by pervasive deployment of sensors and the integration
of their measurement in a cloud or equivalent server infrastructure. A
variety of new instruments include smart meters, power monitors, and
measures of solar irradiance, wind speed, and temperature. One goal is
autonomous local power units where good use is made of waste heat.
