OUTDATED: Technology Training - Python & FutureSystems
------------------------------------------------------

... warning:: this section will be updated and replaced.

This section is meant to give an overview of the python tools needed
for doing for this course.

These are really powerful tools which every
data scientist who wishes to use python must know.

NumPy - It is popular library on top of which many other libraries
(like pandas, scipy) are built. It provides a way a vectorizing
data. This helps to organize in a more intuitive fashion and also
helps us use the various matrix operations which are popularly used by
the machine learning community. Matplotlib: This a data visualization
package. It allows you to create graphs charts and other such
diagrams. It supports Images in JPEG, GIF, TIFF format. SciPy: SciPy
is a library built above numpy and has a number of off the shelf
algorithms / operations implemented. These include algorithms from
calculus(like integration), statistics, linear algebra,
image-processing, signal processing, machine learning, etc.

Introduction
""""""""""""

This section is meant to give an overview of the python tools needed
for doing for this course. These are really powerful tools which every
data scientist who wishes to use python must know. This section covers
NumPy, MatPlotLib, and Scipy.


Pycharm
"""""""

is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for programming in
Python. It provides code analysis, a graphical debugger, an integrated
unit tester, integration with git.

Python in 45 minutes
""""""""""""""""""""

Here is an introductory video about the Python programming language
that we found on the internet. Naturally there are many alternatives
to this video, but the video is probably a good start. It also uses
PyCharm which we recommend.

How much you want to understand of python is actually a bit up to
your, while its goot to know classes and inheritance, you may be able
for this class to get away without using it. However, we do recommend
that you learn it.

OUTDATED: Using FutureSystems (Please do not do yet)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section is meant to give an overview of the FutureSystems and how
to use for the Big Data Course. In addition to this creating
FutureSystems Account, Uploading OpenId and SSH Key and how to
instantiate and log into Virtual Machine and accessing Ipython are
covered. In the end we discuss about running Python and Java on
Virtual Machine.



FutureSystems Overview
""""""""""""""""""""""

In this video we introduce FutureSystems in terms of its
services and features.

SSH Key Generation using ssh-keygen command
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

SSH keys are used to identify user accounts in most systems including
FutureSystems. This lesson walks you through generating an SSH key via
ssh-keygen command line tool.

SSH Key Generation via putty (Windows user only)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This lesson is for Windows users.

You will learn how to create an SSH key using PuTTYgen, add the public
key to you FutureSystems portal, and then login using the PuTTY SSH
client.
