Overview of Data Science
------------------------

*What is Big Data, Data Analytics and X-Informatics?*


The course introduction starts with X-Informatics and its rallying
cry. The growing number of jobs in data science is highlighted. The
first unit offers a look at the phenomenon described as the Data
Deluge starting with its broad features. Data science and the famous
DIKW (Data to Information to Knowledge to Wisdom) pipeline are
covered. Then more detail is given on the flood of data from Internet
and Industry applications with eBay and General Electric discussed in
most detail.

In the next unit, we continue the discussion of the data deluge
with a focus on scientific research. He takes a first peek at data
from the Large Hadron Collider considered later as physics Informatics
and gives some biology examples. He discusses the implication of data
for the scientific method which is changing with the data-intensive
methodology joining observation, theory and simulation as basic
methods. Two broad classes of data are the long tail of sciences: many
users with individually modest data adding up to a lot; and a myriad
of Internet connected devices ~~ the Internet of Things.

We give an initial technical overview of cloud computing as
pioneered by companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft with new
centers holding up to a million servers. The benefits of Clouds in
terms of power consumption and the environment are also touched upon,
followed by a list of the most critical features of Cloud computing
with a comparison to supercomputing. Features of the data deluge are
discussed with a salutary example where more data did better than more
thought. Then comes Data science and one part of it ~~ data analytics
~~ the large algorithms that crunch the big data to give big wisdom.
There are many ways to describe data science and several are discussed
to give a good composite picture of this emerging field.

at the phenomenon described as the Data Deluge starting with its broad

What is X-Informatics and its Motto
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This discusses trends that are driven by and accompany Big data. We
give some key terms including data, information, knowledge, wisdom,
data analytics and data science. WE introduce the motto of the course:
Use Clouds running Data Analytics Collaboratively processing Big Data
to solve problems in X-Informatics. We list many values of X you can
defined in various activities across the world.

Jobs
""""

Big data is especially important as there are some many related jobs.
We illustrate this for both cloud computing and data science from
reports by Microsoft and the McKinsey institute respectively. We show
a plot from LinkedIn showing rapid increase in the number of data
science and analytics jobs as a function of time.

Data Deluge: General Structure
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We look at some broad features of the data deluge starting with the
size of data in various areas especially in science research. We give
examples from real world of the importance of big data and illustrate
how it is integrated into an enterprise IT architecture. We give some
views as to what characterizes Big data and why data science is a
science that is needed to interpret all the data.

          
* Video: 13:04: http://youtu.be/mPJ9twAFRQU

Data Science: Process
"""""""""""""""""""""

We stress the DIKW pipeline: Data becomes information that becomes
knowledge and then wisdom, policy and decisions. This pipeline is
illustrated with Google maps and we show how complex the ecosystem of
data, transformations (filters) and its derived forms is.

          
* Video: 4:27: http://youtu.be/ydH34L-z0Rk



Data Deluge: Internet
"""""""""""""""""""""

We give examples of Big data from the Internet with Tweets, uploaded
photos and an illustration of the vitality and size of many commodity
applications.

          
* Video: 3:42: http://youtu.be/rtuq5y2Bx2g



Data Deluge: Business
"""""""""""""""""""""

We give examples including the Big data that enables wind farms, city
transportation, telephone operations, machines with health monitors,
the banking, manufacturing and retail industries both online and
offline in shopping malls. We give examples from ebay showing how
analytics allowing them to refine and improve the customer
experiences.

Data Deluge and Scientific Applications and Methodology
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Overview
""""""""


We continue the discussion of the data deluge with a focus on
scientific research. He takes a first peek at data from the Large
Hadron Collider considered later as physics Informatics and gives some
biology examples. He discusses the implication of data for the
scientific method which is changing with the data-intensive
methodology joining observation, theory and simulation as basic
methods. We discuss the long tail of sciences; many users with
individually modest data adding up to a lot. The last lesson
emphasizes how everyday devices ~~ the Internet of Things ~~ are being
used to create a wealth of data.

Science & Research
""""""""""""""""""

We look into more big data examples with a focus on science and
research. We give astronomy, genomics, radiology, particle physics and
discovery of Higgs particle (Covered in more detail in later lessons),
European Bioinformatics Institute and contrast to Facebook and
Walmart.

* Video 2: 11:49: http://youtu.be/_JfcUg2cheg


Implications for Scientific Method
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We discuss the emergences of a new fourth methodology for scientific
research based on data driven inquiry. We contrast this with third ~~
computation or simulation based discovery - methodology which emerged
itself some 25 years ago.

* Video: 5:07: http://youtu.be/srEbOAmU_g8



Long Tail of Science
""""""""""""""""""""

There is big science such as particle physics where a single
experiment has 3000 people collaborate!.Then there are individual
investigators who don't generate a lot of data each but together they
add up to Big data.

* Video: 2:10: http://youtu.be/dwzEKEGYhqE


Internet of Things
""""""""""""""""""

A final category of Big data comes from the Internet of Things where
lots of small devices ~~ smart phones, web cams, video games collect
and disseminate data and are controlled and coordinated in the cloud.

Clouds
^^^^^^

We describe cloud data centers with their staggering size with up to a
million servers in a single data center and centers built modularly
from shipping containers full of racks. The benefits of Clouds in
terms of power consumption and the environment are also touched upon,
followed by a list of the most critical features of Cloud computing
and a comparison to supercomputing.

Features of Data Deluge I
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

Data, Information, intelligence algorithms, infrastructure, data
structure, semantics and knowledge are related. The semantic web and
Big data are compared. We give an example where "More data usually
beats better algorithms". We discuss examples of intelligent big data
and list 8 different types of data deluge

* Video 1: 8:02: http://youtu.be/FMktnTQGyrw
* Video 2: 6:24: http://youtu.be/QNVZobXHiZw



Data Science Process
""""""""""""""""""""

We describe and critique one view of the work of a data scientists.
Then we discuss and contrast 7 views of the process needed to speed
data through the DIKW pipeline.

Data Analytics
""""""""""""""

Slides (30 pages):

* http://archive2.cra.org/ccc/files/docs/nitrdsymposium/keyes.pdf

We stress the importance of data analytics giving examples from
several fields. We note that better analytics is as important as
better computing and storage capability.  In the second video we look
at High Performance Computing in Science and Engineering: the Tree and
the Fruit.
