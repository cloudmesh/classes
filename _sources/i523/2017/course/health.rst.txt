Health Informatics Case Study
-----------------------------

This section starts by discussing general aspects of Big Data and
Health including data sizes, different areas including genomics, EBI,
radiology and the Quantified Self movement. We review current state of
health care and trends associated with it including increased use of
Telemedicine. We summarize an industry survey by GE and Accenture and
an impressive exemplar Cloud-based medicine system from Potsdam. We
give some details of big data in medicine. Some remarks on Cloud
computing and Health focus on security and privacy issues.

We survey an April 2013 McKinsey report on the Big Data revolution in
US health care; a Microsoft report in this area and a European Union
report on how Big Data will allow patient centered care in the future.
Examples are given of the Internet of Things, which will have great
impact on health including wearables. A study looks at 4 scenarios for
healthcare in 2032. Two are positive, one middle of the road and one
negative. The final topic is Genomics, Proteomics and Information
Visualization.

McKinsey Report on the big-data revolution in US health care
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This lesson covers 9 aspects of the McKinsey report. These are the
convergence of multiple positive changes has created a tipping point
for innovation; Primary data pools are at the heart of the big data
revolution in healthcare; Big data is changing the paradigm: these are
the value pathways; Applying early successes at scale could reduce US
healthcare costs by $300 billion to $450 billion; Most new big-data
applications target consumers and providers across pathways;
Innovations are weighted towards influencing individual
decision-making levers; Big data innovations use a range of public,
acquired, and proprietary data types; Organizations implementing a big
data transformation should provide the leadership required for the
associated cultural transformation; Companies must develop a range of
big data capabilities.

Genomics, Proteomics and Information Visualization
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A study of an Azure application with an Excel frontend and a cloud
BLAST backend starts this lesson. This is followed by a big data
analysis of personal genomics and an analysis of a typical DNA
sequencing analytics pipeline. The Protein Sequence Universe is
defined and used to motivate Multi dimensional Scaling MDS. Sammon's
method is defined and its use illustrated by a metagenomics example.
Subtleties in use of MDS include a monotonic mapping of the
dissimilarity function. The application to the COG Proteomics dataset
is discussed. We note that the MDS approach is related to the well
known chisq method and some aspects of nonlinear minimization of chisq
(Least Squares) are discussed.

Next we continue the discussion of the COG Protein Universe
introduced in the last lesson. It is shown how Proteomics clusters are
clearly seen in the Universe browser. This motivates a side remark on
different clustering methods applied to metagenomics. Then we discuss
the Generative Topographic Map GTM method that can be used in
dimension reduction when original data is in a metric space and is in
this case faster than MDS as GTM computational complexity scales like
N not N squared as seen in MDS.

Examples are given of GTM including an application to topic models in
Information Retrieval. Indiana University has developed a
deterministic annealing improvement of GTM. 3 separate clusterings are
projected for visualization and show very different structure
emphasizing the importance of visualizing results of data analytics.
The final slide shows an application of MDS to generate and visualize
phylogenetic trees.
