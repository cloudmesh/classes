Gregor von Laszewski is an Assistant Director of Cloud Computing in
the DSC. His is also an Adj. Assoc. Professor of the Intelligent
Systems Engineering Department at Indiana University. He held a
position at Argonne National Laboratory from Nov. 1996 â€“ Aug.  2009
where he was last a scientist and a fellow of the Computation
Institute at University of Chicago. During the last two years of that
appointment he was on sabbatical and held a position as Associate
Professor and the Director of a Lab at Rochester Institute of
Technology focussing on Cyberinfrastructure. He received a Masters
Degree in 1990 from the University of Bonn, Germany, and a Ph.D. in
1996 from Syracuse University in computer science. He was involved in
Grid computing since the term was coined. He was the lead of the Java
Commodity Grid Kit (http://www.cogkit.org) which provides till today a
basis for many Grid related projects including the Globus
toolkit. Current research interests are in the areas of Cloud
computing. He is leading the effort to develop a simple IaaS client
available at as OpenSource project at
http://cloudmesh.github.io/client/

His Web page is located at http://gregor.cyberaide.org. To contact him
please send mail to laszewski@gmail.com. For class related e-mail
please use Piazza for this class.

In his free time he teaches Lego Robotics to high school students. In 2015
the team won the 2nd prize in programming design in Indiana. If you like
to volunteer helping in this effort please contact him.

He offers also the opportunity to work with him on interesting
independent studies. Current topics include but are not limited to

* cloudmesh
* big data for NIST
* big data benchmarking.
* scientific impact of supercomputer and data centers.
* STEM and other educational activities while using robotics or big data
   
Please contact me if you are interested in this.

Geoffrey C. Fox received a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics from Cambridge University
and is now distinguished professor of Informatics and Computing, and
Physics at Indiana University where he is director of the Digital
Science Center, Chair of Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering
and Director of the Data Science program at the School of Informatics
and Computing.  He previously held positions at Caltech, Syracuse
University and Florida State University after being a postdoc at the
Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
and Peterhouse College Cambridge. He has supervised the PhD of 68
students and published around 1200 papers in physics and computer
science with an index of 70 and over 26000 citations.  He currently
works in applying computer science from infrastructure to analytics in
Biology, Pathology, Sensor Clouds, Earthquake and Ice-sheet Science,
Image processing, Deep Learning, Manufacturing, Network Science and
Particle Physics. The infrastructure work is built around Software
Defined Systems on Clouds and Clusters. The analytics focuses on
scalable parallelism.

He is involved in several projects to enhance the capabilities of
Minority Serving Institutions. He has experience in online education
and its use in MOOCs for areas like Data and Computational Science. He
is a Fellow of APS (Physics) and ACM (Computing).

Teaching Assistants

Hyungro Lee
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: /images/Hyungro.jpg

**Hyungro Lee** is a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Indiana
University working with Dr. Geoffrey C. Fox. Prior to beginning the
PhD program, Hyungro worked as a software engineer in the Cyworld
Group (social networking platform in South Korea) at SK
Communications, developing communications platforms including emails,
texts and messaging at large scale to support over 40 million
users. From this work he developed an interest in how distributed
systems achieve scalability and high availability along with managing
resources efficiently. He is currently working on the FutureSystems
project to support Big Data Analysis Software Stacks in Virtual
Clusters. He was also working on the FutureGrid project, an NSF funded
significant new experimental computing grid and cloud test-bed to the
research community, together with user supports. His research
interests are parallel and distributed systems, and cloud computing

Juliette Zerick
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Juliette Zerick** is a first-year ISE grad. She has not yet picked
a specialization, but she has taken a liking to robotics. She received
her undergraduate degree at the University of Mary Washington and
has traveled to various schools and labs, eventually winding up working
as a data scientist at AT&T, and now Indiana University. She does not
like having her picture taken, so to locate her, just look for the TA
lugging a motorcycle helmet around.

Saber Sheybani
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: /images/saber.jpg

**Saber Sheybani** is a PhD student of Intelligent Systems Engineering - 
Neuroengineering at Indiana University Bloomington. He works with Dr 
Eleftherios Garyfallidis on medical image processing. He has contributed 
to DIPY, which is one of the most widely used software packages for 
Diffusion-MRI data analysis. He has also worked on parameter estimation 
for biological neural networks with Dr Eduardo Izquierdo. His research 
interests span the application of computational tools on analyzing neural data.


Miao Jiang
