Contributing
============

.. note:: We assume you are using a Linux or OSX operating system. If
          you use Windows, you can use virtualbox and install for
          example ubuntu 16.04. An alternative is to use gitbash
   
Contributing content to this web page is easy. First, you have to **fork**
the repository while going to the link:

* https://github.com/cloudmesh/classes

And press the fork icon. Now you can clone or directly manipulate your
fork from the web browser. If you clone, you need to make sure you
clone from your fork.

We assume you use Python 3.6.2. If not please find instructions on how
to install it. We recommend that you use `pyenv` so you can install
multiple python environments.

Next, you can cd to the `classes` directory and make the
modifications. Check them locally with::

  pip install -r requirements.txt
  make
  make view

To change things you can simply edit files in the docs/source
directory. Commit the changes and push them into your **local fork**. Now
you can create on the web page for the classes a pull request.

If accepted the request will be merged and you will be credited via
your github account. Make sure you use git config to set your name and
e-mail. Please remember that pull requests are merged by a human and
it will take time. This is not an instantaneous action.

MD vs. RST
----------

If you see an .md file and an .rst file in the same directory, never
edit the rst file. This file will be automatically created. In a
future version we will remove the rst file and only have the md file
in the directory.

Using GitHub
------------

These instructions assume that you are using git from the
commandline. For Linux or OSX, please follow our instructions on how
to install it which is provided as part of the lessons.

If you use windows you can install
:ref:`git for windows <https://git-for-windows.github.io/>`_ and than
you can open up Gitbash in your classes directory.

First you need to initialize your directory for use with Git::
  
	git init

Next you need to set your user name and email to get credit for your
work::

	git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
	it config --global user.email yourusername@iu.edu

Next you need to pull the information down from your forked repository.
You will need to enter your Github username and password when
prompted::
  
	git pull https://github.com/username/classes

With all the files downloaded to your local directory, you can begin editing
the rst files with a plain text editor.

When you have changes to commit to the repository, you will first have to set
the origin for the changes. You only need to do this the first time you commit
changes, so do not worry about this step every time you push your
changes::

	git remote add origin https://github.com/username/classes.git

Now you are ready to add the files you changed::
  
	git add -A

Then commit the changes with a meaningful comment explaining what you
did::
  
	git commit -m "A message indicating what you changed"

Finally you can push your changes up to Github::

	git push -u origin master
	
Once you have done that, open up a browser and go to your forked project on Github.
When you have verified that the changes are there, you can issue a pull request for
your work to be integrated into the original repository by clicking the *Pull Request*
field in the right hand corner beneath the topics.


Creating a Pull Request in GitHub
---------------------------------

Create a pull request to propose and collaborate on changes to a
repository. These changes are proposed in a branch, which ensures that
the master branch only contains finished and approved work. Pull
requests can only be opened if there are differences between your branch
and the upstream branch. You can specify which branch you'd like to
merge your changes into when you create your pull request.

Create a branch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at
one time. When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making
a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time. If
someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on
your branch, you could pull in those updates. When a change is ready,
they merge their branch into master. You can follow the steps for
creating a branch:

-  Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says branch:
   master on your repository.

-  Type a branch name, for example: new\_branch, into the text box.

-  Select the blue Create branch box or press “Enter” on the keyboard.

Make and commit changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.
-  Write a commit message that describes your changes.
-  Click Commit changes button.

Pull Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^

As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a
discussion, even before the code is finished. \* Click the Pull Request
tab, then from the Pull Request page, click the green New pull request
button. \* Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make
sure they’re what you want to submit. \* When you think that you are
ready to submit, click the big green Create Pull Request button. \* Give
your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes.

Merge your Pull Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this final step, it’s time to bring your changes together – merging
your edited branch into the master branch.

-  Click the green Merge pull request button to merge the changes into
   master.
-  Click Confirm merge.
-  Go ahead and delete the branch, since its changes have been
   incorporated, with the Delete branch button in the purple box.

Adding bibligraphic references
------------------------------

We use a single refrence file formated in *bibtex*. The file is
located in docs/source/refs.bib. We use sphinx-bibtex to manage the
refernces in rst pages. However, it has the disadvantage that we can
only have on refrence section per bib file. In order to simplify
management as we may cite the same refernces in differnt files it is
not useful to develop a bib file for each rst file. INstead we
developed the following pragmatic approach.

Here is the process that we automatically apply in the *Makefile*

* We identify all rst files that have the cite command in it.
* We copy the refs.bib file into the same directory as the originating
  rst file. Lets assume the file is called *filename.rst*
* We than rename in the file for this directory to *filename-tmp.bib*
  indicating it is not checked into github
* In gitignore we have a rule that excludes them 

The only thing you have to do in order to use refernces is to make the
index unique and to add a section such as the following to your
document::
  
  References
  ----------

  .. bibliography:: filename-tmp.bib
     :style: unsrt
     :cited:
     :labelprefix: filename

Please note the unique filename. To properly geberate the citations we
remommend you use::

  make clean; make

  


Exercise
--------

To do this assignment you need to learn about making small changes and
how to document them with `gitchangelog`: 

* if you fix a spelling error: your commit message must::
    
    chg:dev: corrected spelling error
  
* if you try to add a larger text you added real content, you can use
  "chg:usr: added section about how to do this and that and the other"
  where you replace this and that and the other with what you actually
  contributed

.. warning:: do always create small pull request. They are easier to
             accept. If you create many different changes in many
             different locations in files the likelihood is that we
             reject the pull request and you have to split it up and
             redu, costing time on your side. This is part of learning
             how we use git.

EContrib.0:
   If you find an md file and an rst file with the same prefix, which
   filed should you edit?
   
EContrib.1:
   Identify a spelling error on the web page or another item
   to improve. Fork the Web page, fix the error and create a pull request.

EContrib.2:
   Identify a section that is not covered by this material, but could
   be useful. Add such a section and create a pull request so your
   contribution can be added. Work with others that review your
   section before submitting so we make sure no one else is working on
   this already. If they do we bring you in contact with them.

EContrib.3:
   How do you clone from your fork? What is the difference between
   your fork and the main repository? How do you identify it is your
   fork you clone from?

EContrib.4:
   We use the creation of the class Web site on your computer to
   benchmark your machine. This benchmark will be used as part of some
   class assignments. To do so execute the following and write
   down/copy the times you get::

     make clean
     time make

   You will see something like::

     real	2m36.662s
     user	2m34.473s
     sys	0m1.467s

   Now we want you to run it again after you touched a file::

     touch docs/source/faq.rst

   Now rerun the timed make. You will see an output such as::

     real	0m27.853s
     user	0m27.394s
     sys	0m0.334s

   The only thing we are interested in is the time behind real, as
   well as some information about your computer, e.g.::

     computer: MacBook Pro, 15-in, 2016, 2.9GHz, 16GB, 2133Mhz, LPDDR3
     make clean: 2m36.662s
     make update: 0m27.853s
     python: 3.6.2

   We will post a form in which you can enter your information. We
   found that we can use this information to check if you may have an
   issue with your computer or your setup.

EContrib.5:
   Why do we ask you to do multiple pull requests? What could be the
   consequence if you make hundrets of changes in one pull request?
