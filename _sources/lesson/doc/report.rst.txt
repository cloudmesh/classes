Report Format
=============

Although we provide **trivial** but detailed report format
requirements, we observed over the years that some students still
asked us can I make my report shorter, or can i use a different format?
The answer to these questions is **no**. Furthermore, we observed that
the same students than went ahead and played with the formating and
introduced empty lines, increased tables or figures, or worse modified the
fontsize to circumvent the page limit requirement.

Thus we have adopted a much simpler approach that is easy to summarize

1. We provide you with a **high quality** report template format that you
   must not change and is used by millions of researchers.
2. All references must be managed with jabref as reference management tool and
   must be provided in addition to the document.
3. If your document does not follow the format or we find that you
   have modified the style of the template we provide will return the document
   without review. 
4. It is in the students responsibility to use the template format
   from the beginning on. In fact, our assignments will use the
   template for all assignments and not just your term paper or term
   report. 

The template for the report is available from:

* https://github.com/bigdata-i523/sample-hid000/tree/master/paper1

Please copy all files into your project directory and modify
accordingly. Naturally you do not need to copy the sample
images. 

Over the years, we have not yet found **ANY** student that
has written a better report in Word than students that use
LaTeX. This is based on the fact that students useing LaTeX focus
on writing content and students using Word focus on making their
reports pretty and focus less on content. We also found that
including images into papers in Word is inferior to the mechanisms
that LaTeX provides.

Hence, it is in your best interest to use LaTeX. The good news is that
we have made it simple for you to use it. Furthermore, you are allowed to use
online services. An example report in PDF format is available:

* `report.pdf <https://github.com/cloudmesh/classes/blob/master/docs/source/format/report/latex/report.pdf>`_
  
We provide a very simple `Makefile
<https://github.com/bigdata-i523/sample-hid000/tree/master/paper1/Makefile>`_
that allows you to do editing with immediate preview as documented in
the LaTeX lesson.  Due to LaTeX being a **trivial** ASCII based format
and having a superior bibliography management you will save yourself
many hours of work that you will face while fighting with Word. We got feedback from
those that tried it and they thanked us later.  Furthermore, in case
you are in a team, you can use either git while collaboratively
developing the LaTeX document, use sharelatex, or overleaf.

1. Your final document must be committed in git and as LaTeX is ASCII
   based you can do thous throughout the semester and have backups via
   git.
2. You will be using jabref to manage your bibliography and as LaTeX
   has build in support for bibliography management there is not much
   you need to pay attention to, all Format of the references is done
   for you in case you entered them correctly
3. You do not modify our theme.
4. All images and tables are placed at the end of the paper.   
5. Git wil be used to submit all documents.   
6. You are allowed to use sharelatex or overleave so you do not have
   to install LaTeX on your computer, but see 5. and the next paragraph.

The final submission must be in **the
class** git. We will not review any documents stored on sharelatex or
overleaf or in any git repository not belonging to the class. Your
final submission will include the bibliography file(s) as a separate
document(s). All images must be placed in an images folder and submitted
in your repository with the originals. When using sharelatex or
overleaf you must replicate the directory layout carefully from our
template and include your final documents in git with a Makefile that
can recreate the document. It is in your responsibility that this
works. We will regenerate the document from source before we grade
it. Thus it is not sufficient to just check in the final PDF. 
The report must be spell checked.

.. warning:: There will be **NO EXCEPTION** to this. We will not
             review your report if its submission is incomplete.

Leverage parallel editing
-------------------------

In most cases you will be able to work in groups on class
projects. This allows you to develop the report collaboratively. Here
are some options:

#. LaTeX and git: THis option will likely safe you time as you can
   use jabref also for manageing collaborative bibliographies and
#. MS onedrive: It allows you to edit a word document in
   collaboration. We recommend that you use a local installed version
   of Word and do the editiong with that, rather than useing the
   online verison. The online editor has some bugs. See also
   (untested):

   http://usefulcodes.blogspot.com/2015/01/using-jabref-to-import-bib-to-microsoft.html 
#. Google Drive: google drive could be used to collaborate on text
   that is than pasted into document. he final document will not
   accept as google document. You must use the 2 column ACM
   template. We observed that students that use google docs lack
   structure and we no longer allow it as final document format. It
   also does not allow us to uniformly compare the documents between
   each other. It is easy to transfer it to LaTeX.

Timemanagement Tips
-------------------

Obviously taking a class takes time

#. It takes time to read the information
#. It takes time understand the information
#. It takes time to do the project
#. This will get you in trouble: *There are still 10 weeks left till
   the project is due so let me start in 4 weeks ...*. Postponing the
   project till the last moment

#. Do not spend significant time on unimportant documentation and
   setup. Instead spend time to develop cmd5 comamnds and scripts that
   do these things automatically
  
Report Checklist
----------------

This partiald list may serve as a way to check if you follow the rules

#. Have you written the report in the specified format?
#. Have you included an acknowledgement section?
#. Have you included the report in git?
#. Have you specified the HID, names, and e-mails of all team members in
   your report. E.g. the Real Names that are registered in Canvas?
#. Have you included the project number in the report?
#. Have you included all images in native and PDF format in git in
   the images folder?
#. Have you added the bibliography file that you managed with jabref
#. In case you used word have you also provided the endnote file
#. Have you added an appendix describing who did what in the project
   or report?
#. Have you spellchecked the paper?
#. Are you useing **a** and **the** properly? 
#. Have you made sure you do not plagiarize?
#. Have you not used phrases such as shown in the Figure below, but
   instead used as shown in Figure 3 when referring to the 3rd
   figure?
#. Have you capitalized "Figure 3", "Table 1", ... ?
#. Any figure that is not referred to explicitly in the text must be
   removed.
#. Are the figure captions bellow the figures and not on top. (Do
   not include the titles of the figures in the figure itself but instead use the caption
   or that information?
#. When using tables have you put the table caption on top?
#. Make the figures large enough so we can read the details. If needed
   make the figure over two columns?
#. Do not worry about the figure placement if they are at a different
   location than you think. Figures are allowed to float. If you want
   you can place all figures at the end of the report?
#. Are all figures and tables at the end?
#. Do not use the word "I" instead use we even if you are the sole
   author?
#. Do not use the phrase "In this paper/report we show" instead use
   "We show". It is not important if this is a paper or a report and
   does not need to be mentioned.
#. Do not artificially inflate your report if you are bellow the page
   limit and have nothing to say anymore.
#. If your paper limit is 12 pages but you want to hand in 120 pages,
   please check first with an instructor ;-)
#. Check in your current work of the report on a weekly basis to show
   consistent progress.
#. Please use the dedicated report format for class. It may not be the
   ACM or IEEE format, but may have some additions that make
   management of bibliographies easier. Do follow our instructions for
   bibliographies.
#. Do not use the characters & # % in the paper if you use LaTeX. If
   you use them you prabably need a \ in front of them.
#. If you want to say and do not use & but use the word and.
#. (I524) Is in your report directory a README.rst file in it as shown in the
   example project that we introduced you to?
#. (I523) you do not have to place a readme in your report or paper
   directories. Instead create a README.md in your hid or pid directories.
   
If you observe something missing let us know.

In case you are allowed to use word The following applies in addition

#. Are you manageing your refernces in jabref and endnote (we need
   both)
#. Are you using the right template we have a special 2 column template
   for the class that is a modified version from the 2 column ACM
   template
#. Are you using build in numbered section management? MSWord has
   Sections that must be used
#.  Are you using real bulleted lists in Word and not just a "*" or a
    "-"?
#. Have you carelessly pasted and copied into the document without
   using proper formats. E.g. in MSWord this is a problem. You need to
   fix the format and use the build in format. Not that if you paste
   wrong you effect the format styles.
#. Have you created not only a docx document but also the PDF.
#. Make sure you use .docx and not .doc

   
If you have other things to add, send them via piazza and we will add
them here.

README.md
---------

For I523, Fall 2017, we will manage all papers via github.com. You
will be added to our github at

* https://github.com/bigdata-i523

and assigned an hid (homework index directory) directory with a unique
hid number for you. In addition, once you decide for a project, you
will aslso get a project id (pid) and a directory in which you place
the projects. Projects must not be placed in hid directories as they
are treated differently and a class proceedings is automatically created
based on your submission.

As part of the hid directory, you will need to create a README.md file
in it, that **must** follow a specific format. The good news is that
we have developed an easy template that with common sense you can
modify easily. The template is located at

* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigdata-i523/sample-hid000/master/README.md

As the format may have been updated over time it does not hurt to
revisit it and compare with your README.md and make corrections.  It
is important that you follow the format and not eliminate the lines
with the three quotes. The text in the quotes is actually yaml. yaml
is a data format the any data scientist must know. If you do not, you
can look it up. However, if you follow our rules you should be
good. If you find a rule missing for our purpose, let us know. We like
to keep it simple and want you to fill out the *template* with your
information.

Simple rules:

* replace the hid nimber with your hid number.
* naturally if you see sample- in the directory name you need to
  delete that as your directory name does not have sample- in it.
* do not ignore where the author is to be placed, it is in a list
  starting with a -
* there is always a space after a -
* do not introduce empty lines
* do not use TAB and make sure your editor does not bay accident
  automatically creates tabs. This is probably the most frequent error
  we see.
* do not use any : & _ in the attribute text including titles
* an object defined in the README.md must have on a single type
  field. for example in the project section. Make sure you select only
  one type and delete the other
* in case you have long paragraphs you can use the > after the
  abstract
* Once you understood how the README.md works, please delete the comment
  section.
  

   
README.rst (for I524, Spring 2017)
----------------------------------

In the directory that containes the report, please include the
following README.rst file. Without this file we will not review your document::

   Title: The title of your paper (one line)

   Author: The author s of the paper (one line)

   HID: The HID of the authors in the order as specified in authors (one line)

   PID: The PID of the paper (there will be exactly one)

   E-mail: The e-mails of the authors in the order of the author list (one line)

   Format: latex or word (specify one)
   
Please note that all information has an empty line between them and
all information is stored in one line

This information is used to autogenerate the class proceedings.
