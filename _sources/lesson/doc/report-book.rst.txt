Documenting Scientific Research
===============================

An important part of any scientific research is to document it. This
is often done through scientific confernces or journal articles. Hence
it is important to learn how to prepare and submit such papers. Most
conferences accept typically the papers in PDF format but require the
papers to be prepared on MSWord or in LaTeX. While working with many
students in the past we noticed however that those students using Word
often spend unnecessarily countles hours on trying to make there
papers beautiful while actually violating the template provided by the
conference. Furthermrore, we noticed that the same students had issues
with bibliography management. Instead of Word helping the student it
provided the illusion to be easier than LaTeX but when adding up the
time spend on the paper we found that LaTeX actually saved time. This
has been especially true with the advent of collaborative editing
services such as sharelatex \cite{} and overleaf \cite{}.

In this section we provide you with a professional template that is
used for either system based on the ACM standard that you can use to
write papers. Naturally this will be extremely useful if the quality
of your research is strong enough to be submitted to a conference.
We structure this section as follows. Although we do not recommend
that you use MSWord for your editing of a scientific paper, we have
included a short section about it and outline some of its pitfalls
that initially you may not think is problematic, but has proven to be
an issue with students. Next we will focus on introducing you to LaTeX
and showcasing you the advantages and disadvantages. We will dedictae
an entire section on bibliography management and teach you jhow to use
jabref which clearly has advantages for us. 

Having a uniform report format not only helps the students but allow
allows the comparision of paper length and effort as part of teaching
a course. We have added an entire section to this chapter that
discusses how we can manage a *Class Proceedings* form papers that are
contributed by teams in the class.

Professional Paper Format
-------------------------

The report format we suggest here is based on the standard ACM
proccedings format. It is of very high quality and can be adapted for
your own activities. Moreover, it is possible to use most of teh text
to adapt to other formats in case the conference you intend to submit
your paper to has a different format. The ACM format is always a good
start. 

Important is that you do not need to change the template but you can
change some parameters in case you are not submitting the paper to a
conference but use it for class papers. Certainly you should not
change the spacing or the layout and instead focus on writing
content. As for bibliography management we recommend you use jabref
which we will introduce in Section \ref{}.

We recommend that you carefully study the requirements for the report
format. We would nat want that your paper gets rejected by a journal,
conference or the class just because you try to modify the format or
do not follow the establishe publication guidlines.

The template we are providing is available from:

* https://github.com/cloudmesh/classes/tree/master/docs/source/format/report

Convenient compressed files are available at

* https://github.com/cloudmesh/classes/tree/master/docs/source/format/report.tar.gz
* https://github.com/cloudmesh/classes/tree/master/docs/source/format/report.zip

You will find in it a modified ACM proceedings templates for Word and
for LaTeX that has an identification box removed on the lower left
hand side of the firts page. This is done for classes so that you have
more space to write. In case you must submit to a confernce you can
use the original ACM template. This template can be found at


Submission Requirements
-----------------------

Althogh the initial requirement for some conferences or journals is
the document PDF, in many cases you must be prepared to provide the
source when submitting to the conference. This includes the submission
of the original images in an images foder. You may ba asked to package
the document into a folder with all of its sources and submit to the
conference for professional publication.


Microsoft Word
--------------

Microsoft word will provide you with the initial impression that you
will safe lots of time writing in it while you see the layout of the
document. This will be initaially true, but once you progress to the
more challanging parts and later pages such as image menagement and
bibliography management you will see some issues. Thes include that
figure placement in Word need sto be done just right in order for
images to be where they need. We have seen students spending hours
with the placement of figures in a paper but when they did additional
cahnges the images jumped around and were not at the place wher eteh
students expected them to be. SO if you work with images, make sure
you understand how to place them. Also always use relative caption
counters so that if an image gets placed elsewhere the counter stays
consistent. So nefer use justthe number, but a refernce to the figure
when referring to it. Recently a new bibliography management system
was added to Word. However, however it is not well documented and the
refrences are placed in the system bibliography rather than a local
managed bibliography. This mah have severe consequences when working
with many authors on a paper. The same is true when using Endnote. We
have heard in many occasions that the combination of endnote and Word
destroyed documents. You certainly do not want that to happen the day
before your deadline. Also in classes we observed that those using
LaTeX deliver better structured and written papers as the focus is on
text and not beatuiful layout.

For all these reasons we do not recommend that you use Word.

LaTeX
-----

In LaTeX where we have an easier time with this as we can just ignore
all of these issues due to relative good image palcement and excellent
support for academic reference management. Hence, it is in your best
interest to use LaTeX. The information we provide here will make it
easy for you to get started and write a paper in no time as it is just
like filling out a form.


Working in a Team
-----------------

Today reaserch is done in potentially large reasearch teams. This also
include thewriting of a document. There are multiple ways this is done
these days and depends on the system you chose.

In MSWord you can use skydrive, while for LaTeX you can use sharelatex
and overleaf. However, in many cases the use of github is possible as
the same grousps that develop teh code are also familiar with
github. Thus we provide you here also with the introdcution on how to
write a document in github while group members can contribute.

Here are the options:

#. LaTeX and git: This option will likely safe you time as you can
   use jabref also for manageing collaborative bibliographies and
#. sharelatex: an online tool to write latex documents
#. overleaf: an online tool to write latex documents
#. MS onedrive: It allows you to edit a word document in
   collaboration. We recommend that you use a local installed version
   of Word and do the editiong with that, rather than useing the
   online verison. The online editor has some bugs. See also
   (untested):
   http://www.paulkiddie.com/2009/07/jabref-exports-to-word-2007-xml/,
   http://usefulcodes.blogspot.com/2015/01/using-jabref-to-import-bib-to-microsoft.html 
#. Google Drive: google drive could be used to collaborate on text
   that is than pasted into document. However it is just a starting
   point as it does not support typically the format required by the
   publisher. Hence at one point you need to swithc to one of the
   other systems.


Timemanagement
--------------

Obviously writing a paper takes time and you need to carfully make
sure you devote enough time to it. The important part is that the
paper should not be an after thought but should be the initial
activity to conduct and execute your research. Remeber that

#. It takes time to read the information
#. It takes time understand the information
#. It takes time to do the research

For deadlines the following will get you in trouble:

#. *There are still 10 weeks left till
   the deadline, so let me start in 4 week ...*. Procrastenation is
   your worst enemy.

#. If you work in a team that has time managemnet issues address them
   immediately

#. Do not undersstimate the time it takes to prepare the final
   submission into the submission system. Prepare automated scripts
   that can deliver the package for submission in minutes rather than
   hours by hand.


  
Paper Checklist
---------------

In this section we summarize a number of checks that you may perform
to make sure your paper is properly fomated and in excelent
shape. Naturally this list is just a partial list and if you find
things we shoudl add here, let us know.

#. Have you written the report in the specified format?
#. Have you included an acknowledgement section?
#. Have you included the paper in the submission system (In our class
   it is git)?
#. Have you specified proper identification in the submission
   system. THis is typically a form or ASCII text that needs to be
   filled out (In our case it is a README.md file that includes a
   homework ID, names of the authors, and e-mails)?
#. Have you included all images in native and PDF format in the
   submission system?
#. Have you added the bibliography file that you managed (In our case
   jabref to make it simple for you)?
#. In case you used word have you also provided the jabref?
#. In case of a class and if you do a multiauthor paper, have you
   added an appendix describing who did what in the paper?
#. Have you spellchecked the paper?
#. Are you useing **a** and **the** properly? 
#. Have you made sure you do not plagiarize?
#. Is the title properly capitallized?
#. Have you not used phrases such as shown in the Figure below, but
   instead used as shown in Figure 3 when referring to the 3rd
   figure?
#. Have you capitalized "Figure 3", "Table 1", ... ?
#. Have you removed any figure that is not referred explicitly in the
   text (As shown in Figure ..) 
#. Are the figure captions bellow the figures and not on top. (Do
   not include the titles of the figures in the figure itself but instead use the caption
   or that information?
#. When using tables have you put the table caption on top?
#. Make the figures large enough so we can read the details. If needed
   make the figure over two columns?
#. Do not worry about the figure placement if they are at a different
   location than you think. Figures are allowed to float. If you want
   you can place all figures at the end of the report?
#. Are all figures and tables at the end?
#. In case you copied a figure from another paper you need to ask for
   copyright permission. IN case of a class paper you **must** include
   a refernce to the original in the caption.
#. Do not use the word "I" instead use we even if you are the sole
   author?
#. Do not use the phrase "In this paper/report we show" instead use
   "We show". It is not important if this is a paper or a report and
   does not need to be mentioned.
#. Do not artificially inflate your paper if you are bellow the page
   limit and have nothing to say anymore.
#. If your paper limit is 12 pages but you want to hand in 120 pages,
   please check first ;-)
#. Do not use the characters & # % in the paper if you use LaTeX. If
   you use them you prabably need a \ in front of them.
#. If you want to say and do not use & but use the word and.
#. Latex uses double single open quotes and douple single closed
   quotes for quates. Have you made sure you replaced them?
#. Pasting and copying from the Web often results in non ascii
   charaters to be used in your text, please remove them and replace
   accordingly.

In case of a class   
   
#. Check in your current work of the paper on a weekly basis to show
   consistent progress.
#. Please use the dedicated report format for class. It may not be the
   ACM or IEEE format, but may have some additions that make
   management of bibliographies easier. Do follow our instructions for
   bibliographies.


In case you are allowed to use word in class, such as the one we teach
at IU, the following applies in addition:

#. Are you manageing your refernces in jabref and endnote (we need
   both)
#. Are you using the right template we have a special 2 column template
   for the class that is a modified version from the 2 column ACM
   template
#. Are you using build in numbered section management? MSWord has
   Sections that must be used
#.  Are you using real bulleted lists in Word and not just a "*" or a
    "-"?
#. Have you carelessly pasted and copied into the document without
   using proper formats. E.g. in MSWord this is a problem. You need to
   fix the format and use the build in format. Not that if you paste
   wrong you effect the format styles.
#. Have you created not only a docx document but also the PDF.
#. Make sure you use .docx and not .doc


If you observe something missing let us know.


Example Paper
-------------

An example report in PDF format is available:

* `report.pdf <https://github.com/cloudmesh/classes/blob/master/docs/source/format/report/latex/report.pdf>`_


Creating the PDF from LaTeX on your Computer
--------------------------------------------

Latex can be easily installoed on any computer as long as you have
enough space. Furthermore if your machine can execute the make command
we have provided in the standard report format a simple 
`Makefile
<https://github.com/cloudmesh/classes/blob/master/docs/source/format/report/latex/Makefile>`_
that allows you to do editing with immediate preview as documented in
the LaTeX lesson.


Class Specific README.md
------------------------

For the class we will manage all papers via github.com. You
will be added to our github at

* https://github.com/bigdata-i523

and assigned an hid (homework index directory) directory with a unique
hid number for you. In addition, once you decide for a project, you
will aslso get a project id (pid) and a directory in which you place
the projects. Projects must not be placed in hid directories as they
are treated differently and a class proceedings is automatically created
based on your submission.

As part of the hid directory, you will need to create a README.md file
in it, that **must** follow a specific format. The good news is that
we have developed an easy template that with common sense you can
modify easily. The template is located at

* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigdata-i523/sample-hid000/master/README.md

As the format may have been updated over time it does not hurt to
revisit it and compare with your README.md and make corrections.  It
is important that you follow the format and not eliminate the lines
with the three quotes. The text in the quotes is actually yaml. yaml
is a data format the any data scientist must know. If you do not, you
can look it up. However, if you follow our rules you should be
good. If you find a rule missing for our purpose, let us know. We like
to keep it simple and want you to fill out the *template* with your
information.

Simple rules:

* replace the hid nimber with your hid number.
* naturally if you see sample- in the directory name you need to
  delete that as your directory name does not have sample- in it.
* do not ignore where the author is to be placed, it is in a list
  starting with a -
* there is always a space after a -
* do not introduce empty lines
* do not use TAB and make sure your editor does not bay accident
  automatically creates tabs. This is probably the most frequent error
  we see.
* do not use any : & _ in the attribute text including titles
* an object defined in the README.md must have on a single type
  field. for example in the project section. Make sure you select only
  one type and delete the other
* in case you have long paragraphs you can use the > after the
  abstract
* Once you understood how the README.md works, please delete the comment
  section.
* Add a chapter topic that your paper belongs to
