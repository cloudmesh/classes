ESP8266
=======

When working with a external hardware such as the NodeMCU you will find
a lot of information on the internet about it. It is a bit difficult at
times to assess what you need to program it. You are exposed to many
choices. A NodeMCU typically comes with Lua. However you have many other
choices. Such choices include multiple programming languages such as
Lua, MicroPython, Arduino/C, Go and others.

As all of them are slightly different you need to identify which works
best for you. In addition you need to install images, programs and
libraries that support your specific language choice.

For our first experiments we will be using MicroPython. This choice is
motivated by the fact that Python is a well established and easy to
learn programming language. Recently many educational institutions are
offering Python as an introductory programming language making this
choice even mor compelling

To simplify the setup and use of the esp8266 for MicroPython we
developed an easy to use commandline tool that allows users to set up
their computer and interact more easily with the board. We believe that
the interface is so simple that it can also be used in STEM activities
and not just in the university or by advanced hobbyists.

Installation of the robot Interface
-----------------------------------

To more easily interface with the robot we have developed a convenient
program that is installed as part of a command tool called cloudmesh.

Install Cloudmesh Robot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WARNING:

::

    The install from pip is not yet working
    To install the robot command you simply type::

        $ pip install cloudmesh.robot

    This will install a program `cms` on your computer that allows you to
    easily communicate with the robot. 

Developers are however encouraged to work with the source code. Thus you
will need to first obtain it with the following commands:

::

    $ mkdir github
    $ cd github
    $ git clone https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh.common.git
    $ git clone https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh.cmd5.git
    $ git clone https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh.robot.git
    $ cd cloudmesh.robot
    $ make source

To test out if the command has been installed, type

::

    $ cms robot welcome

If everything works you should see an ASCII image of R2D2 and C3PO.
Next, we still have to install some additional programs before you can
use other commands.

The installation of these commands requires administrator access. In
case you are not an administrator you can temporarily change yourself as
an administrator in the OSX configuration windows. Than you can execute
the command

::

    $ cms robot osx install

In addition you will need to install the OSX driver for the USB
interface to the esp8266. This is achieved with

::

    $ cms robot osx driver

Now please change your account to be again a standard account.

Now you **MUST REBOOT** the machine. Without rebooting you will not be
able to use the USB drivers.

Once you have successfully installed the drivers and the commands you
can look at the manual page of the robot command with

::

    $ cms robot help

You will see a manual page like this:

::

     Usage:
        robot welcome
        robot osx install
        robot osx driver
        robot image fetch
        robot probe [--format=FORMAT]
        robot flash erase [--dryrun]
        robot flash python [--dryrun]
        robot test
        robot run PROGRAM
        robot credentials set SSID USERNAME PASSWORD
        robot credentials put
        robot credentials list
        robot login
        robot set PORT NOT IMPLEMENTED
        robot ls [PATH]
        robot put [-o] SOURCE [DESTINATION]
        robot get PATH
        robot rm PATH
        robot rmdir PATH
        robot dance FILE IPS
        robot inventory list [--cat] [--path=PATH] [ID]

    Arguments:
        FILE   a file name

    Options:
        -f      specify the file

Testing the board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can use you ESP8266, you must have the appropriate drivers
installed on your computer. Click on `this
link <https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh.robot/blob/7859b395fd15e4d6ced679b05893c9a91957c956/documentation/source/espdrivers.md>`__
and follow the instructions on how to install these drivers.

Next is to connect a esp8266 with a USB cable to the computer. The
ESP8266 should look similar to this.

After you connected it, press the reset button. Before doing anything on
the board, we must test it. Once you have plugged it in, execute the
following command:

::

    $ cms robot probe

This command takes about ten seconds to execute. The ESP8266's led
should flash irregularly as it is probed. When the probe is finished, an
image similar to the following should appear in your terminal:

::

    +-----------+---------------------------+
    | Attribute | Value                     |
    +-----------+---------------------------+
    | chipid    | b' 0x00d0f9ec'            |
    | mac       | b' 00:10:FA:6E:38:4A'     |
    | tty       | /dev/tty.wchusbserial1410 |
    +-----------+---------------------------+

Please note that you should only have one board attached to your
computer.

Flashing the image onto the robot board
---------------------------------------

Next we need to flash the image on the robot board. Naturally we need to
fetch the image first from the internet. We do this with the command

::

    $ cms robot image fetch

This will fetch an image that contains MicroPython into your local
directory.

Next we need to *flash* the image on the board.

Before you begin, make sure that the ESP8266 is connected to your
computer. The board may come with a preinstalled image such as Lua or
some custom image from the vendor. In order to write programs in python,
we need to the chips to run micropython. To get micropython on our
ESP8266's, a number of steps are required.

Erase the chip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First we need to erase the chip.

Run the following command in your terminal terminal, and then **stop.**

::

    $ cms robot flash erase

Your terminal should respond with the following query:

::

    /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART
    Please press the right buttons
    continue? (Y/n)

Before taking any further steps, press both buttons on the ESP8266 at
the same time. Once you have done this, type ``Y`` and press ``enter``.
The process should take under ten seconds to complete.

Putting Python on the chip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before proceeding, you must once again press both of the buttons on the
ESP8266. Once this is done, you are ready to flash the chip with python
with the following command:

::

    $ cms robot flash python 

Testing if it works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To test running a pyton program execute

::

    $ cms robot test

Be careful as it overwrites the file ``test.py``. If the ESP8266 is set
up properly, it should return this in your terminal:

::

    Count to 3
    1
    2
    3

Execute an arbitrary program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lets assume you have placed a program in the file ``prg.py`` with the
command

::

    $ cms robot put prg.py  

You must reboot the ESP8266 before using a new program. This can be done
manually by pressing the reset button on the chip, or in terminal with
the command

::

    $ cms robot reset

Once the chip is reset, you can run ``prg.py`` with the following
command:

::

    $ cms robot run prg.py

Interactive Python shell on the board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get into the interactive python shell on the board you need to reset
the ESP8266 and run the following command:

::

    $ cms robot login

Cleaning an reinstalling a development version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IN case you are a developer and you need to modify the source code, we
found that it is sometimes necessary to clean your development directory
and libraries. The easiest way to do this is to go to the repository
that you like to reinstall. Let us assume it is *cloudmesh.robot*. Than
the following commands will clean the repository

::

    $ cd cloudmesh.robot
    $ pip uninstall cloudmesh.robot

Do the pip unisntall as many times till you see an error that no more
cloudmesh.robot versions can be found. Than execute

::

    $ make clean

After this you can reinstall it with

::

    $ python setup.py install; pip install -e .

the -e flag is optional, but allows you to change the code without the
need of recompiling. A very useful feature in python.

    led.high()
    led.low()


    import machine
    led = machine.Pin(15,machine.Pin.OUT)
    while True:
        led.high()
        time.sleep(0.5)
        led.low()
        time.sleep(0.5)

Alternative boords
------------------

HUZZAH Feather esp8266
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many different 8266 based alterantive boards exist. One of these boards
is the HUZZAH Feather. IT behaves the same as the other boards, but ay
be using differnt drivers and USB ports. The *cms robot* command line
tool is clever enough to identify automatically if it is attached and
uses the appropriate settings. More documentation about this board can
be found at

-  `doc <https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-huzzah-esp8266/using-nodemcu-lua>`__

This site has also many other examples and you can search for them with
keywords such as feather, esp8266, micropython.

An example on how to use the LED on the *feather* is documented at

-  `Feather HUZZAH
   ESP8266 <https://learn.adafruit.com/micropython-basics-blink-a-led/blink-led>`__

To place micropython on the feather you can plug in the to th eusb port.
The good thing about this board is that you do not need to press any
buttons as it detects the upload nicely. If not make sure to reset it or
for flasshing press both buttons. You can do the following:

Probe the board with

::

    cms robot probe

Erasing the feather is simple as it has a bild in mechanism to detect if
it is going to be erased. Hence no reset button needs to be pressed

::

    cms robot flash erase

Get the python image

::

    cms robot fetch python

Flashing is conducted with 460800 baud, it will take about 15 seconds.
After flashing you should try to login

::

    cms robot login

Set the boudrate to 115200

::

    CTRL-A CTRL-B>

    *** baud: 

type in

::

    115200 <ENTER>

Make sure that echo is switched to OFF

::

    CTRL-A CTRL-C

toogles it. Now you should see

::

    >>>

Try typing in

::

    print("Hello")
