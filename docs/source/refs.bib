It is a command line interface application which supports incremental loads of complete tables, free form (custom) SQL Queries and allows the use of saved and scheduled jobs to import latest updates made since the last import. The imports can also be used to populate tables in Hive or Hbase. Sqoop has the option of export, which allows data to be transferred from Hadoop into a relational database. Sqoop is supported in many different business integration suits like Informatica Big Data Management, Pentaho Data Integration, Microsoft BI Suite and Couchbase :cite:`wiki`.},

  Abstract                 = {Giraffe is a scalable distributed coordination service. Distributed coordination is a media access technique used in distributed systems to perform functions like providing group membership, gaining lock over resources, publishing, subscribing, granting ownership and synchronization together among multiple servers without issues. Giraffe was proposed as alternative to coordinating services like Zookeeper and Chubby which were efficient only in read-intensive scenario and small ensembles. To overcome this three important aspects were included in the design of Giraffe :cite:`giraffePaper`. First feature is Giraffe uses interior-node joint trees to organize coordination servers for better scalability. Second, Giraffe uses Paxos protocol for better consistency and to provide more fault-tolerance. Finally, Giraffe also facilitates hierarchical data organization and in-memory storage for high throughput and low latency.},

Such formal foundation, which has so far been lacking, opens the way to the translation between Taverna workflows and other process models. In particular, the ability to automatically compile a simple domain-specific process description into Taverna facilitates its adoption by e-scientists who are not expert workflow developers. We demonstrate this potential through a practical use case.},

It has features like in-built algorithm library, machine learning studio and a webservice :cite:`www-azureMLSite`. In built algorithm library has implementation of various popular machine learning algorithms like decision tree, SVM, linear regression, neural networks etc. Machine learning studio facilitates creation of predictive models using graphical user interface by dragging, dropping and connecting of different modules that can be used by people with minimal knowledge in the machine learning field. Machine learning studio is a free service for basic version and comes with a monthly charge for advanced versions. Apart from building models, studio also has options to do preprocessing like clean, transform and normalize the data. Webservice provides option to deploy the machine learning algorithm as ready to consume APIs that can be reused in future with minimal effort and can also be published.},

  Abstract                 = {Galois system was built by intelligent software systems team at University of Texas, Austin. As explained in :cite:`www-galoisSite`, ``Galois is a system that automatically executes ''Galoized'' serial C++ or Java code in parallel on shared-memory machines. It works by exploiting amorphous data-parallelism, which is present even in irregular codes that are organized around pointer-based data structures such as graphs and trees''. By using Galois provided data structures programmers can write serial programs that gives the performance of parallel execution. Galois employs annotations at loop levels to understand correct context during concurrent execution and executes the code that could be run in parallel. The key idea behind Galois is Tao-analysis, in which parallelism is exploited at compile time rather than at run time by creating operators equivalent of the code by employing data driven local computation algorithm :cite:`taoParallelismPaper`. Galois currently supports C++ and Java.},

There is neither concept of data tables nor data types. Records are organized in hash table or B+ tree.
Kyoto Cabinet runs very fast. For example, elapsed time to store one million records is 0.9 seconds for hash database, and 1.1 seconds for B+ tree database. Moreover, the size of database is very small. For example, overhead for a record is 16 bytes for hash database, and 4 bytes for B+ tree database. Furthermore, scalability of Kyoto Cabinet is great.

considered. David Josephsen in :cite:`nagios-book` depicted Nagios ''as
a specification language and foundation for building well designed
monitoring systems that can scale to serve any organization.'' Nagios
allows extensions to be plugged in and to collaborate with its core
through APIs. Plugins can be developed via static languages like C or
script languages. This mechanism empowers Nagios to monitor a large
set of various scenarios yet being very
flexible. :cite:`nagios-paper-2012` emphasises Nagios' ''flexible
modular architecture, Nagios allows users to develop custom modules to
enhance the system functionality in many different ways.'' Besides its

Second, it enables users to start, execute and monitor jobs on the resources allocated to them. Finally, it intermediates to resolve conflicts on resources for pending work by maintaining them in a queue. The slurm architecture has following components: a centralized manager to monitor resources and work, may have a backup manager, daemon on each server to provide fault-tolerant communications, an optional daemon for clusters with multiple mangers and tools to initiate, terminate and report about jobs in a graphical view with network topology. It also provides around twenty additional plugins that could be used for functionalities like accounting, advanced reservation, gang scheduling, back fill scheduling and multifactor job prioritization.},
