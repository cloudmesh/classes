                  management system with a large user base among the
                  e-Science community. Such formal foundation, which
                  has so far been lacking, opens the way to the
                  translation between Taverna workflows and other
                  process models. In particular, the ability to
                  automatically compile a simple domain-specific
                  process description into Taverna facilitates its
                  adoption by e-scientists who are not expert workflow
                  developers. We demonstrate this potential through a
                  practical use case.},

                  learning algorithms. :cite: 'tensorflow-paper-2016'
                  TensorFlow has a flexible architecture allowing it
                  to be executed with minimal change to many
                  hetegeneous systems such as CPUs and GPUs of mobile
                  devices, desktop machines, and servers. TensorFlow
                  can "express a wide variety of algorithms, including
                  training and inference algorithms for deep neural
                  netowrk models, and it has been used for conducting
                  research and for deploying machine learning systems
                  into production across more than a dozen
                  areas". :cite: 'www-tensorflow' describes that
                  TensorFlow utilizes data flow graphs in which the
                  "nodes in the graph represent mathematical
                  operations, while the graph edges represent the
                  multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated
                  between them."  TensorFlow was developed by the
                  Google Brain Team and has a reference implementation
                  that was released on 2015-11-09 under the Apache 2.0

  Abstract =	 {Apache Amabari is an open source platform that
                  enables easy management and maintenance of Hadoop
                  clusters, regardless of cluster size. Ambari has a
                  simplified Web UI and robust REST API for automating
                  and controlling cluster operations.
                  :cite:`www-hortonworks-ambari` illustrates Ambari to
                  provide key benefits including easy installation,
                  configuration, and management with features such as
                  Smart Configs and cluster recommendations and Ambari
                  Blueprints, to provide repeatable and automated
                  cluster creation. Ambari provides a centralized
                  security setup that automates security capabilities
                  of clusters. Ambari provides a holistic view for
                  cluster monitoring and provides visualizations for
                  operation metrics. :cite:`www-ambari` provides
                  documentation about Ambari, including a quick start
                  guide for installing a cluster with
                  Ambari. :cite:`www-github-ambari` provides the

                  and share community developed roles. Users' GitHub
                  accounts are used for authentication, allowing users
                  to import roles to share with the ansible

                  Ansible roles are encapsulated and reusable tools
                  for organizing automation content. Thus a role
                  contains all tasks, variables, and handlers that are
                  necessary to complete that
                  role. :cite:`Ansible-book-2016` depicts roles as the
                  most powerful part of Ansible as they keep playbooks
                  simple and readable. "They provide reusable
                  definitions that you can include whenever you need
                  and customize with any variables that the role

  1) The words / label units need to be separated by dash marks, ' - ', instead of periods.  For example, Misc{www-bi-vt-edu};

  2) In addition, I think the labels are supposed to be more descriptive so that you and others have an idea about the information to which the label is referring.  For example, the www-bi-vt-edu label should be something like www-biodiversity-foo-bar;

  3) We are supposed to include as much information as possible versus the bare minimum.  The citations need a Month field, a Year field and a Note field.  The latter should have "accessed dd-mth-yyyy" in it.  NOTE: the Month field should use a three-letter month short name, e.g., jan, jun or dec, as should the "mth" in "dd-mth-yyyy";

  4) You used the top-level domain name for each of your citations.  Those need to be changed to the specific web pages from which you pulled your information;

  5) The titles in the title field need to be the exact name of the web resource;

  6) The titles for www.bi.vt.edu and www.portal.futuresystems.org are the same.  One or the other, probably the bi.vt.edu entry, needs a completely different title.

  7) Citations need an author field.  If not an individual, the citation should use the corporate entity / organization as the author.

  Abstract = {This paper describes the design of a cloud computing
                  platform - e-Science Central (e- SC) - which
                  provides both Software and Platform as a Service for
                  scientific data management, analysis and
                  collaboration. e-SC can be deployed on both private
                  (e.g. Eucalyptus) and public Clouds (Amazon AWS and
                  Microsoft Windows Azure). The SaaS application
                  allows scientists to upload data, edit and run
                  workflows, and share results in the cloud. It is
                  underpinned by a scalable cloud platform consisting
                  of a set of services designed to support the needs
                  of scientists. The platform is exposed to developers
                  so that they can easily upload their own analysis
                  services into the system and make these available to
                  other users. A REST-based API is also provided so
                  that external applications can leverage the
                  platform’s functionality. This paper describes the
                  design of e-SC, focusing on its exploitation of
                  clouds. Its usage is demonstrated by a description
                  of a recent project in which it was used for
                  chemical modeling by cancer researchers.},

  Abstract = {TOSCA is a new OASIS standard to describe composite
                  applications and their management. The structure of
                  an application is described by a topology, whereas
                  management plans describe the application’s
                  management functionalities, e. g., provisioning or
                  migration. Winery is a tool offering an HTML5-based
                  environment for graph-based modeling of application
                  topologies and defining reusable component and
                  relationship types. Thereby, it uses TOSCA as
                  internal storage, import, and export format. This
                  demonstration shows how Winery supports modeling of
                  TOSCA-based applications. We use the school
                  management software Moodle as running example
                  throughout the paper.},

  abstract = {A large number of MPI implementations are currently
                  available, each of which emphasize different aspects
                  of high-performance computing or are intended to
                  solve a specific research problem. The result is a
                  myriad of incompatible MPI implementations, all of
                  which require separate installation, and the
                  combination of which present significant logistical
                  challenges for end users. Building upon prior
                  research, and influenced by experience gained from
                  the code bases of the LAM/MPI, LA-MPI, and FT-MPI
                  projects, Open MPI is an all-new, production-
                  quality MPI-2 implementation that is fundamentally
                  centered around component concepts. Open MPI
                  provides a unique combination of novel features
                  previously unavailable in an open-source,
                  production-quality implementation of MPI. Its
                  component architecture provides both a stable
                  platform for third-party research as well as
                  enabling the run-time composition of independent
                  software add-ons. This paper presents a high-level
                  overview the goals, design, and implementation of
                  Open MPI.},

                  based on coarse grained lock server and a library
                  that the client applications link against. As per
                  the 2016 paper, an open-source implementation of the
                  Google Chubby lock service was provided by the

  Abstract =	 {''Kyoto Cabinet is a library of routines for
                  managing a database. The database is a simple data
                  file containing records, each is a pair of a key and
                  a value. Every key and value is serial bytes with
                  variable length. Both binary data and character
                  string can be used as a key and a value. Each key
                  must be unique within a database. There is neither
                  concept of data tables nor data types. Records are
                  organized in hash table or B+ tree.  Kyoto Cabinet
                  runs very fast. For example, elapsed time to store
                  one million records is 0.9 seconds for hash
                  database, and 1.1 seconds for B+ tree
                  database. Moreover, the size of database is very
                  small. For example, overhead for a record is 16
                  bytes for hash database, and 4 bytes for B+ tree
                  database. Furthermore, scalability of Kyoto Cabinet
                  is great. The database size can be up to 8EB
                  (9.22e18 bytes).''},

                  implementation technology enables running containers

                  application; instead of requiring some job
                  scheduler. The issue of using a job scheduler is
                  that a waiting queue is required. Few examples of
                  Pilot Jobs are the
                  :cite:`pilot-job-falkon-paper-2007` Falkon

                  jobs are typically associated with both Parallel
                  computing as well as Distributed computing. Their
                  main aim is to reduce the dependency on queues and
                  the associated multiple wait times.
                  :cite:`www-pilot-job-paper-2016` Using pilot jobs
                  enables us to have a multilevel technique for the
                  execution of various workloads. This is so because
                  the jobs are typically acquired by a placeholder job
                  and they relayed to the workloads.},

  abstract =	 {:cite:`www-google-pub-sub` Google Pub/Sub provides
                  an asynchronous messaging facility which assists the
                  communication between independent applications. It
                  works in real time and helps keep the two
                  interacting systems independent. It is the same
                  technology used by many of the Google apps like
                  GMail, Ads, etc. and so integration with them
                  becomes very
                  easy. :cite:`www-google-pub-sub-features` Some of
                  the typical features it provides are: (1) Push and
                  Pull - Google Pub/Sub integrates quickly and easily
                  with the systems hosted on the Google Cloud Platform
                  thereby supporting one-to-many, one-to-one and
                  many-to-many communication, using the push and pull
                  requests. (2) Scalability - It provides high
                  scalability and availability even under heavy load
                  without any degradation of latency. This is done by
                  using a global and highly scalable design. (3)
                  Encryption - It provides security by encryption of
                  the stored data as well as that in transit. Other
                  than these important features, it provides some
                  others as well, like the usage of RESTful APIs,
                  end-to-end acknowledgement, replicated storage,

                  :cite:`www-RDF` is a model that facilitates the
                  interchange of data on the Web.  Using RFD enables
                  us to merge data even if the underlying schemas
                  differ.  :cite:`www-sesame` Sesame has now
                  officially been integrated into RDF4J Eclipse
                  project.  Sesame takes in the natively written code
                  as the input and then performs a series of
                  transformations, generating kernels for various
                  platforms.  :cite:`sesame-paper-2013` In order to
                  achieve this, it makes use of the feature
                  identifier, impact predictor, source-to-source
                  translator and the auto-tuner.  The feature
                  identifier is concerned with the extraction and
                  detection of the architectural features that are
                  important for application performance.  The impact
                  predictor determines the performance impact of the
                  core features extracted above.  A source-to-source
                  translator transforms the input code into a
                  parametrized one; while the auto-tuner helps find
                  the optimal solution for the processor.},

  abstract =	 {:cite:`www-paas` OpenShift was launched as a PaaS
                  (Platform as a Service) by Red Hat in the Red Hat
                  Summit, 2011.  :cite:`www-developers-openshift` It
                  is a cloud application development and hosting
                  platform that envisages shifting of the developer's
                  focus to development by automating the management
                  and scaling of applications.  Thus,
                  :cite:`www-openshift` OpenShift enables us to write
                  our applications in any one web development language
                  (using any framework) and it itself takes up the
                  task of running the application on the web.  This
                  has its advantages and disadvantages - advantage
                  being the developer doesn't have to worry about how
                  the stuff works internally (as it is abstracted
                  away) and the disadvantage being that he cannot
                  control how it works, again because it is
                  abstracted.  :cite:`openshift-blog` OpenShift is
                  powered by Origin, which is in turn built using
                  Docker container packaging and Kubernetes container
                  cluster.  Due to this, OpenShift offers a lot of
                  options, including online, on-premise and open
                  source project options.},

                  for Python. It enables the Python developers to make
                  use of services like Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2.

                  :cite:`www-boto-amazon-python-sdk` Boto3 has two
                  distinct levels of APIs - client and

                  is provided by the client APIs. Resource APIs
                  provide resource objects and collections to perform
                  various actions by accessing the attributes.  Boto3

  abstract =	 {:cite:`RMBDP-Book` Askalon was developed at the
                  University of Innsbruck.  It is application
                  development as well as a runtime environment. It
                  allows easy execution of distributed work flow
                  applications in service oriented grids. It uses a
                  Service Oriented Architecture. Also, for its Grid
                  middleware it uses the Globus Toolkit. The work flow
                  applications are developed using Abstract Grid Work
                  flow Language (AGWL). The architecture has various
                  components like the resource broker responsible for
                  brokerage functions like management and reservation,
                  information service for the discovery and
                  organization of resources and data, metascheduler
                  for mapping in the Grid, performance analysis for
                  unification of performance monitoring and
                  integration of the results and the Askalon
                  scheduler.  The Metascheduler is of special
                  significance since it consists of two major
                  components - the workflow converter and the
                  scheduling engine. The former is responsible for
                  conversion of traditional workflows into directed
                  acyclic graphs (DAGs) while the later one is
                  responsible for the scheduling of workflows for
                  various specific tasks. It has a conventional
                  pluggable architecture which allows easy integration
                  of various services. By default, the Heterogeneous
                  Earliest Finish Time (HEFT) is used as the primary
                  scheduling algorithm.},

  Abstract =	 {Giraffe is a scalable distributed coordination
                  service. Distributed coordination is a media access
                  technique used in distributed systems to perform
                  functions like providing group membership, gaining
                  lock over resources, publishing, subscribing,
                  granting ownership and synchronization together
                  among multiple servers without issues. Giraffe was
                  proposed as alternative to coordinating services
                  like Zookeeper and Chubby which were efficient only
                  in read-intensive scenario and small ensembles. To
                  overcome this three important aspects were included
                  in the design of Giraffe. First feature is Giraffe
                  uses interior-node joint trees to organize
                  coordination servers for better scalability. Second,
                  Giraffe uses Paxos protocol for better consistency
                  and to provide more fault-tolerance. Finally,
                  Giraffe also facilitates hierarchical data
                  organization and in-memory storage for high
                  throughput and low latency.},

  Abstract =	 {Azure Machine Learning is a cloud based service that
                  can be used to do predictive analytics, machine
                  learning or data mining. It has features like
                  in-built algorithm library, machine learning studio
                  and a webservice. In built algorithm library has
                  implementation of various popular machine learning
                  algorithms like decision tree, SVM, linear
                  regression, neural networks etc. Machine learning
                  studio facilitates creation of predictive models
                  using graphical user interface by dragging, dropping
                  and connecting of different modules that can be used
                  by people with minimal knowledge in the machine
                  learning field. Machine learning studio is a free
                  service for basic version and comes with a monthly
                  charge for advanced versions. Apart from building
                  models, studio also has options to do preprocessing
                  like clean, transform and normalize the
                  data. Webservice provides option to deploy the
                  machine learning algorithm as ready to consume APIs
                  that can be reused in future with minimal effort and
                  can also be published.},

  Abstract =	 {Galois system was built by intelligent software
                  systems team at University of Texas, Austin. As
                  explained in website, ``Galois is a system that
                  automatically executes ''Galoized'' serial C++ or
                  Java code in parallel on shared-memory machines. It
                  works by exploiting amorphous data-parallelism,
                  which is present even in irregular codes that are
                  organized around pointer-based data structures such
                  as graphs and trees''. By using Galois provided data
                  structures programmers can write serial programs
                  that gives the performance of parallel
                  execution. Galois employs annotations at loop levels
                  to understand correct context during concurrent
                  execution and executes the code that could be run in
                  parallel. The key idea behind Galois is
                  Tao-analysis, in which parallelism is exploited at
                  compile time rather than at run time by creating
                  operators equivalent of the code by employing data
                  driven local computation algorithm
                  :cite:`taoParallelismPaper`. Galois currently
                  supports C++ and Java.},

                  workload manager is an open source, scalable cluster
                  resource management tool used for job scheduling in
                  small to large Linux cluster using multi-core
                  architecture. As per, SLURM has three key
                  functions. First, it allocates resources to users
                  for some duration with exclusive and/or
                  non-exclusive access. Second, it enables users to
                  start, execute and monitor jobs on the resources
                  allocated to them. Finally, it intermediates to
                  resolve conflicts on resources for pending work by
                  maintaining them in a queue. The slurm architecture
                  has following components: a centralized manager to
                  monitor resources and work, may have a backup
                  manager, daemon on each server to provide
                  fault-tolerant communications, an optional daemon
                  for clusters with multiple mangers and tools to
                  initiate, terminate and report about jobs in a
                  graphical view with network topology. It also
                  provides around twenty additional plugins that could
                  be used for functionalities like accounting,
                  advanced reservation, gang scheduling, back fill
                  scheduling and multifactor job prioritization.},

                  services, could provision both virtual and physical
                  machines through the Compute service’s API. But, the

                  by understanding the data in a natural language as
                  well as analyzing structured and unstructured
                  data. It was initally developed as a question and
                  answer tool more specifically to answer questions on
                  the popular quiz show "Jeopardy" by IBM's DeepQA
                  research team led by David Ferrucci but now it has
                  been seen as helping doctors and nurses in the
                  treatment of cancer. :cite:'www-ibmwatson'
                  illustrates that with Watson you can create bots
                  that can engage in conversation with you, you can
                  even provide personalized recommendations to watson
                  by understanding a user's personality, tone and
                  emotion. Watson uses the Apache Hadoop framework in
                  order to process the large volume of data needed to
                  generate an answer by creating in-memory datasets

  Abstract =	 {Elasticsearch :cite:`www-elasticsearch` is a real
                  time distributed, RESTful search and analytics
                  engine which is capable of performing full text
                  search operations for you. It is not just limited to
                  full text search operations but it also allows you
                  to analyze your data, perform CRUD operations on
                  data, do basic text analysis including tokenization
                  and filtering. :cite:`www-elasticsearch-intro` For
                  example while developing an E-commerce website,
                  Elasticsearch can be used to store the entire
                  product catalog and inventory and can be used to
                  provide search and autocomplete suggestions for the
                  products. Elasticsearch is developed in Java and is
                  an open source search engine built which uses
                  standard RESTful APIs and JSON on top of Apache's
                  Lucene - which is a full text search engine
                  library. Clinton Gormley & Zachary Tong
                  :cite:'elasticsearch-book' describes elastic search
                  as "A distributed real time document store where
                  every field is indexed and searchable". He also
                  mentions that "Elastic search is capable of scaling
                  to hundreds of servers and petabytes of structured
                  and unstructured
                  data". :cite:'www-elasticsearch-hadoop' mentions
                  that Elastic search can be used on big data by using
                  the Elasticsearch-Hadoop (ES-Hadoop)
                  connector. ES-Hadoop connector lets you index the
                  Hadoop data into the Elastic Stack to take full
                  advantage of the Elasticsearch engine and returns
                  output through Kibana
                  visualizations. :cite:'www-wikipedia-elasticsearch'
                  A log parsing engine "Logstash" and analytics and
                  visualization platform "Kibana" are also developed

  Abstract =	 {Nagios is a platform, which provides a set of
                  software for network infrastructure monitoring. It
                  also offers administrative tools to diagnose when
                  failure events happen, and to notify operators when
                  hardware issues are detected. Specifically,
                  :cite:`www-nagios` illustrates that Nagios is
                  consist of modules including: a core anqd its
                  dedicated tool for core configuration, extensible
                  plugins and its frontend. Nagios core is designed
                  with scalability being well considered. David
                  Josephsen in :cite:`nagios-book` depicted Nagios
                  ''as a specification language and foundation for
                  building well designed monitoring systems that can
                  scale to serve any organization.'' Nagios allows
                  extensions to be plugged in and to collaborate with
                  its core through APIs. Plugins can be developed via
                  static languages like C or script languages. This
                  mechanism empowers Nagios to monitor a large set of
                  various scenarios yet being very
                  flexible. :cite:`nagios-paper-2012` emphasises
                  Nagios' ''flexible modular architecture, Nagios
                  allows users to develop custom modules to enhance
                  the system functionality in many different ways.''
                  Besides its open source components, Nagios also has
                  commercial products to serve needing clients.},
