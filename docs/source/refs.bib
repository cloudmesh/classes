                  management system with a large user base among the
                  e-Science community. Such formal foundation, which
                  has so far been lacking, opens the way to the
                  translation between Taverna workflows and other
                  process models. In particular, the ability to
                  automatically compile a simple domain-specific
                  process description into Taverna facilitates its
                  adoption by e-scientists who are not expert workflow
                  developers. We demonstrate this potential through a
                  practical use case.},

                  algorithms for deep neural netowrk models, and it
                  has been used for conducting research and for

                  command line tool that enables users to discover,
                  create, and share community developed roles. Users'
                  GitHub accounts are used for authentication,
                  allowing users to import roles to share with the
                  ansible community. :cite:`www-galaxy-ansible`
                  describes how Ansible roles are encapsulated and
                  reusable tools for organizing automation
                  content. Thus a role contains all tasks, variables,
                  and handlers that are necessary to complete that
                  role. :cite:`Ansible-book-2016` depicts roles as the
                  most powerful part of Ansible as they keep playbooks
                  simple and readable. "They provide reusable
                  definitions that you can include whenever you need
                  and customize with any variables that the role
                  exposes." :cite:`www-github-galaxy` provides the

                  network. Asynchronous consensus is solved by the
                  Paxos protocol. The implementation in Chubby is
                  based on coarse grained lock server and a library
                  that the client applications link against. As per
                  the 2016 paper, an open-source implementation of the
                  Google Chubby lock service was provided by the
                  Apache ZooKeeper project. ZooKeeper used a
                  Paxos-variant protocol Zab for solving the

  Abstract =	 {''Kyoto Cabinet is a library of routines for
                  managing a database. The database is a simple data
                  file containing records, each is a pair of a key and
                  a value. Every key and value is serial bytes with
                  variable length. Both binary data and character
                  string can be used as a key and a value. Each key
                  must be unique within a database. There is neither
                  concept of data tables nor data types. Records are
                  organized in hash table or B+ tree.  Kyoto Cabinet
                  runs very fast. For example, elapsed time to store
                  one million records is 0.9 seconds for hash
                  database, and 1.1 seconds for B+ tree
                  database. Moreover, the size of database is very
                  small. For example, overhead for a record is 16
                  bytes for hash database, and 4 bytes for B+ tree
                  database. Furthermore, scalability of Kyoto Cabinet
                  is great. The database size can be up to 8EB
                  (9.22e18 bytes).''},

                  Apache Hadoop and sql databases
                  :cite:`www-sqoop`. The name is a Portmanteau of SQL
                  + Hadoop. It is a command line interface application
                  which supports incremental loads of complete tables,
                  free form (custom) SQL Queries and allows the use of
                  saved and scheduled jobs to import latest updates
                  made since the last import. The imports can also be
                  used to populate tables in Hive or Hbase. Sqoop has
                  the option of export, which allows data to be
                  transferred from Hadoop into a relational
                  database. Sqoop is supported in many different
                  business integration suits like Informatica Big Data
                  Management, Pentaho Data Integration, Microsoft BI
                  Suite and Couchbase :cite:`wiki`.},

  abstract     = {The real time data Processing at Fcabook is carried out using the 
technologies like Scibe,PTail, Puma and ODS. While designing the system, 
facebook primarily focused on the five key decissions that the system 
should incorporate and that included Ease of Use, Performance , 
Fault-tolerance , Scalability and Correctness.:cite: 'www-facebook' "The 
real time data analytics ecosystem at facebook is designed to handle 
hundreds of Gigabytes of data per second via hundreds of data pipelines 
and this system handles over 200,000 events per second with a maximum 
latency of 30 seconds". :cite:'www-facebook'Fcabook focused on the 
Seconds of latency while designing the system and not milliseconds as 
seconds are fast enough to for all the use case that needs to be 
supported, and it allowed facebook to use persistent message bus for 
data transport and this made the system more fault toleranat and 
scalable. :cite:'facebook-paper-2017' The large infrastructure of 
facebook comprises of hundreds of systems distributed across multiple 
data centers that needs a continious monitoring to track their health 
and performance.Which is done by Operational Data Store(ODS).ODS 
comprises of a time series database (TSDB),which is a query service, and 
a detection and alerting system. ODS’s TSDB is built atop the HBase 
storage system.Time series data from services running on Facebook hosts 
is collected by the ODS write service and written to HBase. 

When the data is generated by the user from their devices, an AJAX 
request is fired to facebook,and these requests are then written to a 
log file using Scribe(distributed data transport system), this messaging 
system collect, aggregate and delivers high volume of log data with few 
seconds of latency and high throughput.Scribe stores the data in the 
HDFS(Hadoop Distributed File System) in a tailing fashion, where the new 
events are stored in log files and the files are tailed below the 
current events.The events are then written into the storage HBase on 
distributed machines. This makes the data avalible for both batch and 
real-time processing. Ptail is an internal tool built to aggregate data 
from multiple Scribe stores and It then tails the log files and pulls 
data out for processing. Puma is a stream processing system which is the 
real-time aggregation/storage of data. Puma provides filtering and 
processing of Scribe streams (with a few seconds delay), usually Puma 
batches the storage per 1.5 seconds on average and when the last flush 
completes, then only a new batch starts to avoid the contention issues, 
which makes i fairly real time.},

  abstract  = {Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an open source ,in-memory, key-value 
database which is commonly referred as a data structure server. 
:cite:'redis-book-2011' "It is called a data structure server and not 
simply a key-value store because Redis implements datastructure which 
allows keys to contain binary safe strings ,hashes,sets and sortedsets, 
as well as lists" .Redis’s exceptional performance, simplicity to use 
and implement, and atomic manipulation of data structures lends itself 
to solving problems that are difficult or perform poorly when implemented
 with traditional relational databases.
 :cite:'redis-book-2016' "Salivator Sanfilippo(Creator of open-sorce 
database Redis) makes a strong case that Redis does not need to replace 
the existing database but is an excellent addition to an enterprise for 
new functionalities or to solve sometimes intyractable problems." 

:cite:'redis-book-2016' A very popular use pattern for Redis is an 
in-memory cache for web-applications. The second popular use pattern for 
REDIS is for metric storage of such quantitative data such as web page 
usage and user behaviour on gamer leaderboards where using a bit 
operations on strings, Redis very efficently stores binary information 
on a particular characteristics.The third popular Redis use pattern is a 
communication layer between different systems through a 
publish/subscribe(pub/sub for short), where one can post message to one 
or more channels that can be acted upon by other systems that are 
subscribed to or listening to that channel for incoming message. The 
Comapnies using REDIS includes Twitter to store the timelines of all the 
user , Pinterest stores the user follower graph, Github, popular web 
frameworks like Node.js ,Django,Ruby-on-Rails etc.},

  abstract  = {Data Scientists when working on huge data sets try to extract meaning 
and interpret the data to enhance insight about the various patterns, 
oppurtunities and possiblities that the dataset has to offer. :cite: 
'shark-paper-2012' At a traditional EDW(Enterprrise Data Warehouse) a 
simple data manipulation can be perfpormed using SQL queries but we have 
to rely on other systems to apply the machine learning on thoese 
data.Apache Shark is a distributed query engine developed by the open 
source community whoese goal is to provide a a unified system for easy 
data manipulation using SQL and pushing sophisticated analysis towards 
the data. 

:cite:'shark-paper-2012' Shark is a data Warehouse system built on top 
of Apache Spark which does the parallel data execution and is capable of 
deep data analysis using the Resilient Distributed Datasets(RDD) memory 
abstraction which unifies the SQL query processing engine with 
analytical algorithms based on this common abstraction allowing the two 
to run in the same set of workers and share intermediate data. Since 
RDDs are designed to scale horizontally, it is easy to add or remove 
nodes to accommodate more data or faster query processing thus it can be 
scaled to thoushands o nodes in a fault-toleranat manner 

:cite:'shark-paper-2012' "Shark is built on Hive Codebase and it has the 
ability to execute HIVE QL queries up to 100 times faster than Hive 
without making any change in the existing queries". Shark can run both 
on the StandAlone Mode and Cluster Mode.:cite:'shark-paper-2012' Shark 
can answer the queries 40X faster than Apache Hive and can machine 
learning programs 25X faster than MapReduce programmes. in Apache hadoop 
on large data sets.Thus, this new data analysis system performs query 
processing and complex analytics(iterative Machine learning) at scale 
and efficiently recovers form the failures midway.},

  abstract  = {In pilot job, an application acquires a resource so that it can be 
delegated some work directly by the application; instead of requiring 
some job scheduler. The issue of using a job scheduler is that a waiting 
queue is required. Few examples of Pilot Jobs are the 
:cite:`pilot-job-falkon-paper-2007` Falkon lightweight framework and 
:cite:`pilot-job-htcaas-paper-2007` HTCaaS. Pilot jobs are typically 
associated with both Parallel computing as well as Distributed 
computing. Their main aim is to reduce the dependency on queues and the 
associated multiple wait times. 

:cite:`www-pilot-job-paper-2016` Using pilot jobs enables us to have a 
multilevel technique for the execution of various workloads. This is so 
because the jobs are typically acquired by a placeholder job and they 
relayed to the workloads.},

  abstract     = {:cite:`www-google-pub-sub` Google Pub/Sub provides an asynchronous 
messaging facility which assists the communication between independent 
applications. It works in real time and helps keep the two interacting 
systems independent. It is the same technology used by many of the 
Google apps like GMail, Ads, etc. and so integration with them becomes 
very easy. :cite:`www-google-pub-sub-features` Some of the typical 
features it provides are: (1) Push and Pull - Google Pub/Sub integrates 
quickly and easily with the systems hosted on the Google Cloud Platform 
thereby supporting one-to-many, one-to-one and many-to-many 
communication, using the push and pull requests. (2) Scalability - It 
provides high scalability and availability even under heavy load without 
any degradation of latency. This is done by using a global and highly 
scalable design. (3) Encryption - It provides security by encryption of 
the stored data as well as that in transit. Other than these important 
features, it provides some others as well, like the usage of RESTful 
APIs, end-to-end acknowledgement, replicated storage, etc.},

  Abstract =	 {Giraffe is a scalable distributed coordination
                  service. Distributed coordination is a media access
                  technique used in distributed systems to perform
                  functions like providing group membership, gaining
                  lock over resources, publishing, subscribing,
                  granting ownership and synchronization together
                  among multiple servers without issues. Giraffe was
                  proposed as alternative to coordinating services
                  like Zookeeper and Chubby which were efficient only
                  in read-intensive scenario and small ensembles. To
                  overcome this three important aspects were included
                  in the design of Giraffe :cite:`giraffePaper`. First
                  feature is Giraffe uses interior-node joint trees to
                  organize coordination servers for better
                  scalability. Second, Giraffe uses Paxos protocol for
                  better consistency and to provide more
                  fault-tolerance. Finally, Giraffe also facilitates
                  hierarchical data organization and in-memory storage
                  for high throughput and low latency.},

                  can be used to do predictive analytics, machine
                  learning or datya mining. It has features like
                  in-built algorithm library, machine learning studio
                  and a webservice :cite:`www-azureMLSite`. In built
                  algorithm library has implementation of various
                  popular machine learning algorithms like decision
                  tree, SVM, linear regression, neural networks
                  etc. Machine learning studio facilitates creation of
                  predictive models using graphical user interface by
                  dragging, dropping and connecting of different
                  modules that can be used by people with minimal
                  knowledge in the machine learning field. Machine
                  learning studio is a free service for basic version
                  and comes with a monthly charge for advanced
                  versions. Apart from building models, studio also
                  has options to do preprocessing like clean,
                  transform and normalize the data. Webservice
                  provides option to deploy the machine learning
                  algorithm as ready to consume APIs that can be
                  reused in future with minimal effort and can also be
                  published.},

  Abstract =	 {Galois system was built by intelligent software
                  systems team at University of Texas, Austin. As
                  explained in :cite:`www-galoisSite`, ``Galois is a
                  system that automatically executes ''Galoized''
                  serial C++ or Java code in parallel on shared-memory
                  machines. It works by exploiting amorphous
                  data-parallelism, which is present even in irregular
                  codes that are organized around pointer-based data
                  structures such as graphs and trees''. By using
                  Galois provided data structures programmers can
                  write serial programs that gives the performance of
                  parallel execution. Galois employs annotations at
                  loop levels to understand correct context during
                  concurrent execution and executes the code that
                  could be run in parallel. The key idea behind Galois
                  is Tao-analysis, in which parallelism is exploited
                  at compile time rather than at run time by creating
                  operators equivalent of the code by employing data
                  driven local computation algorithm
                  :cite:`taoParallelismPaper`. Galois currently
                  supports C++ and Java.},

  Abstract =	 {Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM)
                  workload manager is an open source, scalable cluster
                  resource management tool used for job scheduling in
                  small to large Linux cluster using multi-core
                  architecture. As per, :cite:`www-slurmSchedmdSite`
                  SLURM has three key functions. First, it allocates
                  resources to users for some duration with exclusive
                  and/or non-exclusive access. Second, it enables
                  users to start, execute and monitor jobs on the
                  resources allocated to them. Finally, it
                  intermediates to resolve conflicts on resources for
                  pending work by maintaining them in a queue. The
                  slurm architecture has following components: a
                  centralized manager to monitor resources and work,
                  may have a backup manager, daemon on each server to
                  provide fault-tolerant communications, an optional
                  daemon for clusters with multiple mangers and tools
                  to initiate, terminate and report about jobs in a
                  graphical view with network topology. It also
                  provides around twenty additional plugins that could
                  be used for functionalities like accounting,
                  advanced reservation, gang scheduling, back fill
                  scheduling and multifactor job prioritization.},

  Abstract =	 {Elasticsearch :cite:`www-elasticsearch` is a real
                  time distributed, RESTful search and analytics
                  engine which is capable of performing full text
                  search operations for you. It is not just limited to
                  full text search operations but it also allows you
                  to analyze your data, perform CRUD operations on
                  data, do basic text analysis including tokenization
                  and filtering. :cite:`www-elasticsearch-intro` For
                  example while developing an E-commerce website,
                  Elasticsearch can be used to store the entire
                  product catalog and inventory and can be used to
                  provide search and autocomplete suggestions for the
                  products. Elasticsearch is developed in Java and is
                  an open source search engine built which uses
                  standard RESTful APIs and JSON on top of Apache's
                  Lucene - which is a full text search engine
                  library. Clinton Gormley & Zachary Tong
                  :cite:'elasticsearch-book' describes elastic search
                  as "A distributed real time document store where
                  every field is indexed and searchable". He also
                  mentions that "Elastic search is capable of scaling
                  to hundreds of servers and petabytes of structured
                  and unstructured
                  data". :cite:'www-elasticsearch-hadoop' mentions
                  that Elastic search can be used on big data by using
                  the Elasticsearch-Hadoop (ES-Hadoop)
                  connector. ES-Hadoop connector lets you index the
                  Hadoop data into the Elastic Stack to take full
                  advantage of the Elasticsearch engine and returns
                  output through Kibana
                  visualizations. :cite:'www-wikipedia-elasticsearch'
                  A log parsing engine "Logstash" and analytics and
                  visualization platform "Kibana" are also developed
                  alongside Elasticsearch forming a single package.},

  Abstract =	 {Nagios is a platform, which provides a set of
                  software for network infrastructure monitoring. It
                  also offers administrative tools to diagnose when
                  failure events happen, and to notify operators when
                  hardware issues are detected. Specifically,
                  :cite:`www-nagios` illustrates that Nagios is
                  consist of modules including: a core anqd its
                  dedicated tool for core configuration, extensible
                  plugins and its frontend. Nagios core is designed
                  with scalability being well considered. David
                  Josephsen in :cite:`nagios-book` depicted Nagios
                  ''as a specification language and foundation for
                  building well designed monitoring systems that can
                  scale to serve any organization.'' Nagios allows
                  extensions to be plugged in and to collaborate with
                  its core through APIs. Plugins can be developed via
                  static languages like C or script languages. This
                  mechanism empowers Nagios to monitor a large set of
                  various scenarios yet being very
                  flexible. :cite:`nagios-paper-2012` emphasises
                  Nagios' ''flexible modular architecture, Nagios
                  allows users to develop custom modules to enhance
                  the system functionality in many different ways.''
                  Besides its open source components, Nagios also has
                  commercial products to serve needing clients.},

:cite:`www-sesame` Sesame has now officially been integrated
into RDF4J Eclipse project.  Sesame takes in the natively
written code as the input and then performs a series of
transformations, generating kernels for various platforms.
:cite:`sesame-paper-2013` In order to achieve this, it makes
use of the feature identifier, impact predictor,
source-to-source translator and the auto-tuner.  The feature
identifier is concerned with the extraction and detection of
the architectural features that are important for application
performance.  The impact predictor determines the performance
impact of the core features extracted above.  A
source-to-source translator transforms the input code into a
parametrized one; while the auto-tuner helps find the optimal
solution for the processor.},

  abstract     = {:cite:`www-paas` OpenShift was launched as a PaaS (Platform as a 
Service) by Red Hat in the Red Hat Summit, 2011. 
:cite:`www-developers-openshift` It is a cloud application development 
and hosting platform that envisages shifting of the developer's focus to 
development by automating the management and scaling of applications. 
Thus, :cite:`www-openshift` OpenShift enables us to write our 
applications in any one web development language (using any framework) 
and it itself takes up the task of running the application on the web. 
This has its advantages and disadvantages - advantage being the 
developer doesn't have to worry about how the stuff works internally (as 
it is abstracted away) and the disadvantage being that he cannot control 
how it works, again because it is abstracted. 

:cite:`openshift-blog` OpenShift is powered by Origin, which is in turn 
built using Docker container packaging and Kubernetes container cluster. 
Due to this, OpenShift offers a lot of options, including online, 
on-premise and open source project options.},

  abstract  = {Docker is an open-source container based technology.A container allows a 
developer to package up an application and all its part includig the 
stack it runs on, dependencies it is associated with and everything the 
application requirs to run within an isolated enviorment . Docker 
seperates Application from the underlying Operating System in a similar 
way as Virtual Machines seperates the Operating System from the 
underlying Hardware.Dockerizing an application is very lightweight in 
comparison with running the application on the Virtual Machine as all 
the containers share the same underlying kernel, the Host OS should be 
same as the container OS (eliminating guest OS) and an average machine 
cannot have more than few VMs running o them. 

:cite:'docker-book' Docker Machine is a tool that lets you install 
Docker Engine on virtual hosts, and manage the hosts with docker-machine 
commands. You can use Machine to create Docker hosts on your local Mac 
or Windows box, on your company network, in your data center, or on 
cloud providers like AWS or Digital Ocean. For Docker 1.12 or higher 
swarm mode is integerated with the Docker Engine, but on the older 
versions with Machine's swarm option, we can configure a swarm cluster 
Docker Swarm provides native clustering capabilities to turn a group of 
Docker engines into a single, virtual Docker Engine. With these pooled 
resources ,:cite:'www-docker'"you can scale out your application as if 
it were running on a single, huge computer" as swarm can be scaled upto 
1000 Nodes or upto 50,000 containers},
