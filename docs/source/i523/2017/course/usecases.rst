Big Data Use Cases Survey
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This section covers 51 values of X and an overall study of Big data
that emerged from a NIST (National Institute for Standards and
Technology) study of Big data. The section covers the NIST Big Data
Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) Process and summarizes the work of five
subgroups: Definitions and Taxonomies Subgroup, Reference Architecture
Subgroup, Security and Privacy Subgroup, Technology Roadmap Subgroup
and the Requirements andUse Case Subgroup. 51 use cases collected in
this process are briefly discussed with a classification of the source
of parallelism and the high and low level computational structure. We
describe the key features of this classification.


Overview of NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) Process and Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This unit covers the NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG)
Process and summarizes the work of five subgroups: Definitions and
Taxonomies Subgroup, Reference Architecture Subgroup, Security and
Privacy Subgroup, Technology Roadmap Subgroup and the Requirements and
Use Case Subgroup. The work of latter is continued in next two units.

Introduction to NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) Process
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The focus of the (NBD-PWG) is to form a community of interest from
industry, academia, and government, with the goal of developing a
consensus definitions, taxonomies, secure reference architectures, and
technology roadmap. The aim is to create vendor-neutral, technology
and infrastructure agnostic deliverables to enable big data
stakeholders to pick-and-choose best analytics tools for their
processing and visualization requirements on the most suitable
computing platforms and clusters while allowing value-added from big
data service providers and flow of data between the stakeholders in a
cohesive and secure manner.

Definitions and Taxonomies Subgroup
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The focus is to gain a better understanding of the principles of Big
Data. It is important to develop a consensus-based common language and
vocabulary terms used in Big Data across stakeholders from industry,
academia, and government. In addition, it is also critical to identify
essential actors with roles and responsibility, and subdivide them
into components and sub-components on how they interact/ relate with
each other according to their similarities and differences.

For Definitions: Compile terms used from all stakeholders regarding
the meaning of Big Data from various standard bodies, domain
applications, and diversified operational environments. For
Taxonomies: Identify key actors with their roles and responsibilities
from all stakeholders, categorize them into components and
subcomponents based on their similarities and differences. In
particular data Science and Big Data terms are discussed.

Reference Architecture Subgroup
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus-based approach
to orchestrate vendor-neutral, technology and infrastructure agnostic
for analytics tools and computing environments. The goal is to enable
Big Data stakeholders to pick-and-choose technology-agnostic analytics
tools for processing and visualization in any computing platform and
cluster while allowing value-added from Big Data service providers and
the flow of the data between the stakeholders in a cohesive and secure
manner. Results include a reference architecture with well defined
components and linkage as well as several exemplars.

Security and Privacy Subgroup
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus secure
reference architecture to handle security and privacy issues across
all stakeholders. This includes gaining an understanding of what
standards are available or under development, as well as identifies
which key organizations are working on these standards. The Top Ten
Big Data Security and Privacy Challenges from the CSA (Cloud Security
Alliance) BDWG are studied. Specialized use cases include
Retail/Marketing, Modern Day Consumerism, Nielsen Homescan, Web
Traffic Analysis, Healthcare, Health Information Exchange, Genetic
Privacy, Pharma Clinical Trial Data Sharing, Cyber-security,
Government, Military and Education.

Technology Roadmap Subgroup
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus vision with
recommendations on how Big Data should move forward by performing a
good gap analysis through the materials gathered from all other NBD
subgroups. This includes setting standardization and adoption
priorities through an understanding of what standards are available or
under development as part of the recommendations. Tasks are gather
input from NBD subgroups and study the taxonomies for the actors'
roles and responsibility, use cases and requirements, and secure
reference architecture; gain understanding of what standards are
available or under development for Big Data; perform a thorough gap
analysis and document the findings; identify what possible barriers
may delay or prevent adoption of Big Data; and document vision and
recommendations.

Requirements and Use Case Subgroup Introduction I
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""


The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus list of Big
Data requirements across all stakeholders. This includes gathering and
understanding various use cases from diversified application
domains.Tasks are gather use case input from all stakeholders; derive
Big Data requirements from each use case; analyze/prioritize a list of
challenging general requirements that may delay or prevent adoption of
Big Data deployment; develop a set of general patterns capturing the
''essence'' of use cases (not done yet) and work with Reference
Architecture to validate requirements and reference architecture by
explicitly implementing some patterns based on use cases. The progress
of gathering use cases (discussed in next two units) and requirements
systemization are discussed.

This units consists of one or more slides for each of the 51 use
cases - typically additional (more than one) slides are associated
with pictures. Each of the use cases is identified with source of
parallelism and the high and low level computational structure. As
each new classification topic is introduced we briefly discuss it but

Features of 51 Big Data Use Cases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This unit discusses the categories used to classify the 51 use-cases. These categories include concepts used for parallelism and low and high level computational structure. The first lesson is an introduction to all categories and the further lessons give details of particular categories.

Summary of Use Case Classification I
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This discusses concepts used for parallelism and low and high level
computational structure. Parallelism can be over People (users or
subjects), Decision makers; Items such as Images, EMR, Sequences;
observations, contents of online store; Sensors – Internet of Things;
Events; (Complex) Nodes in a Graph; Simple nodes as in a learning
network; Tweets, Blogs, Documents, Web Pages etc.; Files or data to be
backed up, moved or assigned metadata; Particles/cells/mesh
points. Low level computational types include PP (Pleasingly
Parallel); MR (MapReduce); MRStat; MRIter (Iterative MapReduce);
Graph; Fusion; MC (Monte Carlo) and Streaming. High level
computational types include Classification; S/Q (Search and Query);
Index; CF (Collaborative Filtering); ML (Machine Learning); EGO (Large
Scale Optimizations); EM (Expectation maximization); GIS; HPC;
Agents. Patterns include Classic Database; NoSQL; Basic processing of
data as in backup or metadata; GIS; Host of Sensors processed on
demand; Pleasingly parallel processing; HPC assimilated with
observational data; Agent-based models; Multi-modal data fusion or
Knowledge Management; Crowd Sourcing.
