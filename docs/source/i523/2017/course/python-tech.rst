Technology Training - Plotviz
-----------------------------

We introduce Plotviz, a data visualization tool developed at
Indiana University to display 2 and 3 dimensional data. The motivation
is that the human eye is very good at pattern recognition and can
''see'' structure in data. Although most Big data is higher
dimensional than 3, all can be transformed by dimension reduction
techniques to 3D. He gives several examples to show how the software
can be used and what kind of data can be visualized. This includes
individual plots and the manipulation of multiple synchronized
plots.Finally, he describes the download and software dependency of
Plotviz.

Motivation and Introduction to use
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The motivation of Plotviz is that the human eye is very good at
pattern recognition and can ''see'' structure in data. Although most
Big data is higher dimensional than 3, all data can be transformed by
dimension reduction techniques to 3D and one can check analysis like
clustering and/or see structure missed in a computer analysis. The
motivations shows some Cheminformatics examples. The use of Plotviz is
started in slide 4 with a discussion of input file which is either a
simple text or more features (like colors) can be specified in a rich
XML syntax. Plotviz deals with points and their classification
(clustering). Next the protein sequence browser in 3D shows the basic
structure of Plotviz interface. The next two slides explain the core
3D and 2D manipulations respectively. Note all files used in examples
are available to students.

Example of Use I: Cube and Structured Dataset
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Initially we start with a simple plot of 8 points -- the corners of a
cube in 3 dimensions -- showing basic operations such as
size/color/labels and Legend of points. The second example shows a
dataset (coming from GTM dimension reduction) with significant
structure. This has .pviz and a .txt versions that are compared.

Example of Use II: Proteomics and Synchronized Rotation
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This starts with an examination of a sample of Protein Universe
Browser showing how one uses Plotviz to look at different features of
this set of Protein sequences projected to 3D. Then we show how to
compare two datasets with synchronized rotation of a dataset clustered
in 2 different ways; this dataset comes from k Nearest Neighbor
discussion.

Example of Use III: More Features and larger Proteomics Sample
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This starts by describing use of Labels and Glyphs and the Default
mode in Plotviz. Then we illustrate sophisticated use of these ideas
to view a large Proteomics dataset.

Example of Use IV: Tools and Examples
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This lesson starts by describing the Plotviz tools and then sets up
two examples -- Oil Flow and Trading -- described in PowerPoint. It
finishes with the Plotviz viewing of Oil Flow data.

Example of Use V: Final Examples
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This starts with Plotviz looking at Trading example introduced in
previous lesson and then examines solvent data. It finishes with two
large biology examples with 446K and 100K points and each with over
100 clusters. We finish remarks on Plotviz software structure and how
to download. We also remind you that a picture is worth a 1000 words.
