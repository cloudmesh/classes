Homework Submission is done as follows:

#. All assignments will be posted through Canvas
#. You will be provided with a GitLab folder once you register at https://about.gitlab.com/
#. You will complete your assignments and check in your solutions to
   your gitlab.com repository (see :doc:`gitlab`)
#. You will submit to canvas a link to your solution in gitlab

Study groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is very common and encouraged to build study groups to discuss with
each other the content of the class. However such groups should not be
used to copy homework assignments that are intendet for individual
submissions.

When working in a team, we recommend that you use English as the
communication language. This will help those that are not native
English speakers.

Video V5
^^^^^^^^^
      Please watch Section 5 Units 10, 11. Total Length 2.5 hours.


Programming prg1: Python
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Hardware:
        Identify a suitable hardware enviornment that works
        for you to conduct the assignments. Firts you must have access
	to a sufficiently powerful computer. This could be your Laptop
	or Desktop, or you could get access to machines at IU's
	computer labs or virtual machines.

    Setup Python:
        Next you will need to setup Python on the machin or
        verify if python works. We recommend that you use python 2.7
        and *NOT* python 3. We recommend that you follow the
	instructions from python.org and use virtualenv.  As editor
	we recommend you use Pycharm or Emacs.

    Alternative:
        Optionally you can use canopy for some of the simpler
	projects, it is an integrated python environment that is good
	for beginners. We do not recommend anaconda as some libraries
	may not be ported to it yet. IN case you have difficulties
	with canopy, please use python.org

    Useful software:
        - `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_
	      - `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_
	      - `SciPy <https://scipy.org/>`_
	      - `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_
	      - `Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_

    Tasks:
        * Learn Python, E.g. go through the :doc:`python` lesson.
	* Use *virtualenv* and *pip* to customize your environment.
	* Learn `Python pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>` and do a
          simple Python application demonstrating:

		* a linechart
		* a barchart, e.g. a histogram

          Find some real meaningful data such as number of people born
	  in a year or some other more interesting data set to
	  demonstrate the various features.
	* Review of Scipy: look at the scipy manual and be aware what
          you can do with it in case you chose a Project


	Deliverables prg1:

	    The goal of this assignment is to choose one or two datasets
            (see :doc:`datasets`), preprocess it to clean it up, and
            generate a line graph and histogram plot.  Your figures must
            provide labels for the axes along with units.

            Submit your programs in a folder called ``prg1``, which
            must contain the following:

	    * ``requirements.txt``: list of python libraries your programs
	      need as installable by: ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
	    * ``fetchdata.py``: a python program that, when run as ``python
	      fetchdata.py`` will produce dataset files in CSV format
	      called ``data-line.csv`` and ``data-hist.csv``.
	    * ``linechart.py``: a python program that, when run as
	      ``python linechart.py data-line.csv`` will generate a
	      line chart as save it in PNG format to a file called ``linechart.png``.
	    * ``histogram.py``: a python program that, when run as
	      ``python historgram.py data-hist.csv`` will generate
	      a histogram plot as save it in PNG format to a file called
	      ``histogram.png``
	    * ``README.rst``: a RST format file which documents the
	      datasets
	      you used, where you fetched them from, how ``fetchdata.py``
	      cleans them to generate the ``data-{line,hist}.csv`` files.

	    .. warning::

	       Missing items will result in zero points being given

Futuresystems

Assignment Guidelines
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Getting Access and Systems Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For some projects you will need access to a cloud. We recommend you
evaluate which cloud would be most appropriate for your project. This
includes:

* chameleoncloud.org
* furturesystems.org
* AWS (you will be responsible for charges)
* Azure (you will be responsible for charges)
* virtualbox if you have a powerful computer and like to prototype
* other clouds

We intend to make some small number of virtual machines available for
us in a project FG511 on FutureSystems:

* https://portal.futuresystems.org/projects/511

.. note:: FutureSystems OpenStack cloud is currently updated and will
	  not be available till Sept.

Documentation about FutureSystems can be found at
:ref:`OpenStackFutureSystems <ref-quickstart_openstack>`

Once you created an account on FutureSystems and you do a project yOu
can add yourself to the project so you gain access. Systems staff is
available only during regular business hours Mo-Fri 10am - 4pm.

You could also use the cloudmesh client software on Linux and OSX to
access multiple clouds in easy fashion. A Section will introduce this
software.

.. _s_paper_format:

Report and Paper Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


All reports and paper assignments will be using the ACM proceedings
format. The MSWord template can be found here:

* :download:`paper-report.docx <files/paper-report.docx>`

* The URL is 
https://gitlab.com/cloudmesh/fall2016/blob/master/docs/source/files/paper-report.docx


A LaTeX version can be found at

* https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template

however you have to remove the ACM copyright notice in the LaTeX version.

There will be **NO EXEPTION** to this format. In case you are in a
team, you can use either gitlab while collaboratively developing the
LaTeX document or use MicrosoftOne Drive which allows collaborative
editing features. All bibliographical entries must be put into a
bibliography manager such as jabref, endnote, or Mendeley. This will
guarantee that you follow proper citation styles. You can use either
ACM or IEEE reference styles. Your final submission will include the
bibliography file as a separate document.

Documents that do not follow the ACM format and are not accompanied by
references managed with jabref or endnote or are not spell checked
will be returned without review.

Please do not use figures ore tables toe artificially inflate the
length of the report. Make figures readable and provide the original
images. Use PDF for figures and not png, gif, org jpeg. This way the
figures you produce are scalable and zooming into the paper will be
possible.

Report Checklist:

* [ ] Have you written the report in word or LaTeX in the specified
  format.
* [ ] In case of LaTeX, have you removed the ACM copyright information
* [ ] Have you included the report in gitlab.
* [ ] Have you specified the names and e-mails of all team members in
  your report. E.g. the username in Canvas.
* [ ] Have you included all images in native and PDF format in gitlab
  in the images folder.
* [ ] Have you added the bibliography file (such as endnote or bibtex
  file e.g. jabref) in a directory bib.
* [ ] Have you submitted an additional page that describes who did
  what in the project or report.
* [ ] Have you spellchecked the paper.
* [ ] Have you made sure you do not plageurize.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Software Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Develop a software system with OpenStack available on FutureSystems or
Chameleoncloud to support it. Only choose the software option if you
are prepared to take on programming tasks.

In case of a software project, we encourage a group project with up to
three members.  You can use the discussion list for the
`Software Project <http://openedx.scholargrid.org/courses/SoIC/INFO-I-523/Fall_2016/courseware/7870c4bd238147e7a98e6a46f349f0cf/3d53c765145a457cbd003e80897723d4/>`_
to form project teams or just communicate privately with other class
members to formulate a team. The following artifacts are part of the
deliverables for a project

Code:
    You must deliver the code in gitlab. The code must be compilable
    and a TA may try to replicate to run your code. You MUST avoid
    lengthy install descriptions and everything must be installable
    from the commandline.

Project Report:
    A report must be produced while using the format discussed in the
    Report Format section. The following length is required:

    * 3 pages, one student in the project
    * 5 pages, one student in the project
    * 7 pages, one student in the project

    Reports can be longer up to 10 pages if needed.  Your high quality
    scientific report should describe a) What you did b) results
    obtained and c) Software documentation including how to install,
    and run it. If c) is longer than half a page and can not be
    reproduced with shell scripts or easy to folow steps you will get
    points deducted.

Work Breackdown:
    This document is only needed for team projects. A one page PDF
    document describing who did what. It includes pointers to
    the git history that documents the statistics that demonstrate not
    only one student has worked on the project.

License:
    All projects are developed under an open source license such as
    Apache 2.0 License, or similar. You will be required to add a
    LICENCE.txt file and if you use other software identify how it can be
    reused in your project. If your project uses different licenses,
    please add in a README.rst file which packages are used and which
    license these packages have.

Code Repository:
    Code repositories are for code, if you have additional libraries
    that are needed you need to develop a script or use a DevOps
    framework to install such software. Thus zip files and .class, .o
    files are not permissible in the project. Each project must be
    reproducible with a simple script. An example is::

      git clone ....
      make install
      make run
      make view

    Which would use a simple make file to install, run, and view the
    results. Naturally you can use ansible or shell scripts. It is not
    permissible to use GUI based DevOps preinstalled
    frameworks. Everything must be installable form the command line.
