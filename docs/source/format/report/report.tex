\section{Introduction}

This template is designed to assist with creating an article for
I524. The page length is typically done without images. Thus if you
have images in your report, please add additional content to offset
the space captured by images. We do not check exactly, so there is no
reason to contact us if you are a paragraph short, but if you are half
a page short you may add quality content.

\section{Chance for Publishing a Paper}

If this work can lead to a publishable paper, you could engage with
the course instructor as coauthor to work more closely with him/them.
This however requires that the paper be worked on in a regular basis
and that timely contributions from the instructor can be integrated.
Hence this is going to be a significant effort and you need to decide
if you like to conduct this. Naturally the project must be suitable
for such an activity. It may even be that some projects may be
combined.

In such cases if the work is sufficient for publication submission, an
A+ for the class could be considered. It will be however a lot of
work. The length of such a paper is typically 10-12 high quality pages
including figures and references. We may elect for the final
submission to use a different LaTeX style. As Gregor is an expert in
this, changing the format will be simple.

\section{Examples of Article Components}
\label{sec:examples}

The sections below show examples of different article components.

\section{Figures and Tables}

It is not necessary to place figures and tables at the back of the
manuscript. Figures and tables should be sized as they are to appear
in the final article. Do not include a separate list of figure
captions and table titles.

Figures and Tables should be labelled and referenced in the standard
way using the \verb|\label{}| and \verb|\ref{}| commands.

\subsection{Sample Figure}

Figure \ref{fig:false-color} shows an example figure.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\fbox{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/sample}}
\caption{False-color image, where each pixel is assigned to one of seven reference spectra.}
\label{fig:false-color}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Sample Table}

Table \ref{tab:shape-functions} shows an example table.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{\bf Shape Functions for Quadratic Line Elements}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\hline
local node & $\{N\}_m$ & $\{\Phi_i\}_m$ $(i=x,y,z)$ \\
\hline
$m = 1$ & $L_1(2L_1-1)$ & $\Phi_{i1}$ \\
$m = 2$ & $L_2(2L_2-1)$ & $\Phi_{i2}$ \\
$m = 3$ & $L_3=4L_1L_2$ & $\Phi_{i3}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
  \label{tab:shape-functions}
\end{table}

\section{Sample Equation}

Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and
identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$
and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let

\begin{equation}
S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i
\label{eq:refname1}
\end{equation}

denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random
variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal
$\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$. 

\section{Sample Algorithm}

Algorithms can be included using the commands as shown in algorithm
\ref{alg:euclid}.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Euclid’s algorithm}\label{alg:euclid}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{Euclid}{$a,b$}\Comment{The g.c.d. of a and b}
\State $r\gets a\bmod b$
\While{$r\not=0$}\Comment{We have the answer if r is 0}
\State $a\gets b$
\State $b\gets r$
\State $r\gets a\bmod b$
\EndWhile\label{euclidendwhile}
\State \textbf{return} $b$\Comment{The gcd is b}
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Python example}\label{alg:python}
\begin{quote}
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=left]
for i in range(0,100):
  print i
\end{Verbatim}
\end{quote}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Reference Management}

The best programs to manage your references is jabref or emacs. You
can edit the references and verify them with them for format
errors. To cite them use the citation key. You can add multiple bib
files to the bibliography command separated by comma.

\noindent Add citations with the cite command. See
\cite{las14cloudmeshmultiple} for an example on how to use multiple
clouds. In \cite{www-i524} we list the class content.

\section{Supplemental Material}

You can include an appendix with important information and additional
figures if needed. However they must be referenced and follow the same
guidelines as in the main text.  All materials must be associated with
a figure, table, or equation or be referenced in the results section
of the manuscript.  (1) 2D and 3D image files and video must be
labeled “Visualization,” not “Movie,” “Video,” “Figure,” etc.  (2)
Machine-readable data (for example, csv files) must be labeled “Data
File.”  Number data files and visualizations consecutively, e.g.,
“Visualization 1, Visualization 2….”  (3) Large datasets or code files
must be placed in github/gitlab.  Such items should be mentioned in
the text as either “Dataset” or “Code,” as appropriate, and also be
cited in the references list. Appropriate citations in jabref as Misc
need to be created.
