Section 1 - Overview
======================================================================

This section has a technical overview of course followed by a broad
motivation for course.

The course overview covers it's content and structure. It presents the
X-Informatics fields (defined values of X) and the Rallying cry of
course: Use Clouds running Data Analytics Collaboratively processing
Big Data to solve problems in X-Informatics ( or e-X). The courses is
set up as a MOOC divided into units that vary in length but are
typically around an hour and those are further subdivided into 5-15
minute lessons.

The course covers a mix of applications (the X in X-Informatics) and
technologies needed to support the field electronically i.e. to
process the application data. The overview ends with a discussion of
course content at highest level. The course starts with a longish
Motivation unit summarizing clouds and data science, then units
describing applications (X = Physics, e-Commerce, Web Search and Text
mining, Health, Sensors and Remote Sensing). These are interspersed
with discussions of infrastructure (clouds) and data analytics
(algorithms like clustering and collaborative filtering used in
applications). The course uses either Python or Java and there are
Side MOOCs discussing Python and Java tracks.

The course motivation starts with striking examples of the data deluge
with examples from research, business and the consumer. The growing
number of jobs in data science is highlighted. He describes industry
trend in both clouds and big data. Then the cloud computing model
developed at amazing speed by industry is introduced. The 4 paradigms
of scientific research are described with growing importance of data
oriented version.He covers 3 major X-informatics areas: Physics,
e-Commerce and Web Search followed by a broad discussion of cloud
applications. Parallel computing in general and particular features of
MapReduce are described. He comments on a data science education and
the benefits of using MOOC's.

in some traditional areas including Shopping malls and Postal
Services.

Video: http://youtu.be/RxGopRuMWOE

 

Lesson 6 - Computing Model: Industry adopted clouds which are attractive for data analytics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clouds and Big Data are transformational on a 2-5 year time scale.
Already Amazon AWS is a lucrative business with almost a $4B revenue.
We describe the nature of cloud centers with economies of scale
and gives examples of importance of virtualization in server
consolidation. Then key characteristics of clouds are reviewed with
expected high growth in Infrastructure, Platform and Software as a
Service.

Video: http://youtu.be/NBZPQqXKbiw

wisdom paradigm. Data flows through cloud services transforming itself
and emerging as new information to input into other transformations.

Video: http://youtu.be/j9ytOaBoe2k

Lesson 9 - Physics-Informatics Looking for Higgs Particle with Large Hadron Collider LHC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
We look at important particle physics example where the Large
hadron Collider has observed the Higgs Boson. He shows this discovery
as a bump in a histogram; something that so amazed him 50 years ago
that he got a PhD in this field. He left field partly due to the
incredible size of author lists on papers.

Video: http://youtu.be/qUB0q4AOavY
 

Lesson 10 - Recommender Systems I
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many important applications involve matching users, web pages, jobs,
movies, books, events etc. These are all optimization problems with
recommender systems one important way of performing this optimization.
We go through the example of Netflix -- everything is a
recommendation and muses about the power of viewing all sorts of
things as items in a bag or more abstractly some space with funny
properties.

Lesson 14 - Parallel Computing and MapReduce
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
We define MapReduce and gives a homely example from fruit
blending.

Video: http://youtu.be/BbW1PFNnKrE
 

Lesson 15 - Data Science Education
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
We discuss one reason you are taking this course -- Data
Science as an educational initiative and aspects of its Indiana
University implementation. Then general; features of online education
are discussed with clear growth spearheaded by MOOC's where we 
use this course and others as an example. He stresses the choice
between one class to 100,000 students or 2,000 classes to 50 students
and an online library of MOOC lessons. In olden days he suggested
''hermit's cage virtual university'' -- gurus in isolated caves
putting together exciting curricula outside the traditional university
model. Grading and mentoring models and important online tools are
discussed. Clouds have MOOC's describing them and MOOC's are stored in
clouds; a pleasing symmetry.

Video: http://youtu.be/x2LuiX8DYLs


 

Lesson 16 - Conclusions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
The conclusions highlight clouds, data-intensive methodology,
employment, data science, MOOC's and never forget the Big Data
ecosystem in one sentence "Use Clouds running Data Analytics
Collaboratively processing Big Data to solve problems in X-Informatics
educated in data science"

Section 2 - Overview of Data Science: What is Big Data, Data Analytics and X-Informatics? 
===============================================================================================
 

Section Overview 
-----------------------------------------------------------

The course introduction starts with X-Informatics and its rallying
cry. The growing number of jobs in data science is highlighted. The
first unit offers a look at the phenomenon described as the Data
Deluge starting with its broad features. Data science and the famous
DIKW (Data to Information to Knowledge to Wisdom) pipeline are
covered. Then more detail is given on the flood of data from Internet
and Industry applications with eBay and General Electric discussed in
most detail.

In the next unit, we continue the discussion of the data deluge
with a focus on scientific research. He takes a first peek at data
from the Large Hadron Collider considered later as physics Informatics
and gives some biology examples. He discusses the implication of data
for the scientific method which is changing with the data-intensive
methodology joining observation, theory and simulation as basic
methods. Two broad classes of data are the long tail of sciences: many
users with individually modest data adding up to a lot; and a myriad
of Internet connected devices -- the Internet of Things.

We give an initial technical overview of cloud computing as
pioneered by companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft with new
centers holding up to a million servers. The benefits of Clouds in
terms of power consumption and the environment are also touched upon,
followed by a list of the most critical features of Cloud computing
with a comparison to supercomputing. Features of the data deluge are
discussed with a salutary example where more data did better than more
thought. Then comes Data science and one part of it -- data analytics
-- the large algorithms that crunch the big data to give big wisdom.
There are many ways to describe data science and several are discussed
to give a good composite picture of this emerging field.

Unit 4 - Part II: Data Deluge and Scientific Applications and Methodology 
-----------------------------------------------------------
 

Unit Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 

We continue the discussion of the data deluge with a focus on
scientific research. He takes a first peek at data from the Large
Hadron Collider considered later as physics Informatics and gives some
biology examples. He discusses the implication of data for the
scientific method which is changing with the data-intensive
methodology joining observation, theory and simulation as basic
methods. We discuss the long tail of sciences; many users with
individually modest data adding up to a lot. The last lesson
emphasizes how everyday devices -- the Internet of Things -- are being
used to create a wealth of data.

Section 3 - X= Health Informatics Case Study 
===================================================

 

 

Section Overview 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 

This section starts by discussing general aspects of Big Data and
Health including data sizes, different areas including genomics, EBI,
radiology and the Quantified Self movement. We review current state of
health care and trends associated with it including increased use of
Telemedicine. We summarize an industry survey by GE and Accenture and
an impressive exemplar Cloud-based medicine system from Potsdam. We
give some details of big data in medicine. Some remarks on Cloud
computing and Health focus on security and privacy issues.

We survey an April 2013 McKinsey report on the Big Data revolution in
US health care; a Microsoft report in this area and a European Union
report on how Big Data will allow patient centered care in the future.
Examples are given of the Internet of Things, which will have great
impact on health including wearables. A study looks at 4 scenarios for

Lesson 13 - Genomics, Proteomics and Information Visualization I
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
A study of an Azure application with an Excel frontend and a cloud
BLAST backend starts this lesson. This is followed by a big data
analysis of personal genomics and an analysis of a typical DNA
sequencing analytics pipeline. The Protein Sequence Universe is
defined and used to motivate Multi dimensional Scaling MDS. Sammon's
method is defined and its use illustrated by a metagenomics example.
Subtleties in use of MDS include a monotonic mapping of the
dissimilarity function. The application to the COG Proteomics dataset
is discussed. We note that the MDS approach is related to the well
known chisq method and some aspects of nonlinear minimization of chisq
(Least Squares) are discussed.

Video: http://youtu.be/r1yENstaAUE
 

Lesson 14 - Genomics, Proteomics and Information Visualization II
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This lesson continues the discussion of the COG Protein Universe
introduced in the last lesson. It is shown how Proteomics clusters are
clearly seen in the Universe browser. This motivates a side remark on
different clustering methods applied to metagenomics. Then we discuss
the Generative Topographic Map GTM method that can be used in
dimension reduction when original data is in a metric space and is in
this case faster than MDS as GTM computational complexity scales like
N not N squared as seen in MDS. 

Examples are given of GTM including an application to topic models in
Information Retrieval. Indiana University has developed a
deterministic annealing improvement of GTM. 3 separate clusterings are
projected for visualization and show very different structure
emphasizing the importance of visualizing results of data analytics.
The final slide shows an application of MDS to generate and visualize
phylogenetic trees.

Section 5 - Technology Training - Python & FutureSystems (will be updated) 
======================================================================
 

 

Section Overview 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This section is meant to give an overview of the python tools needed
for doing for this course. These are really powerful tools which every
data scientist who wishes to use python must know. This section
covers. Canopy - Its is an IDE for python developed by EnThoughts. The
aim of this IDE is to bring the various python libraries under one
single framework or ''Canopy'' - that is why the name. NumPy - It is
popular library on top of which many other libraries (like pandas,
scipy) are built. It provides a way a vectorizing data. This helps to
organize in a more intuitive fashion and also helps us use the various
matrix operations which are popularly used by the machine learning
community. Matplotlib: This a data visualization package. It allows
you to create graphs charts and other such diagrams. It supports
Images in JPEG, GIF, TIFF format. SciPy: SciPy is a library built
above numpy and has a number of off the shelf algorithms / operations
implemented. These include algorithms from calculus(like integration),
statistics, linear algebra, image-processing, signal processing,
machine learning, etc.

Section 6 - X= Physics Case Study 
======================================================================
 

 

Section Overview 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
This section starts by describing the LHC accelerator at CERN and
evidence found by the experiments suggesting existence of a Higgs
Boson. The huge number of authors on a paper, remarks on histograms
and Feynman diagrams is followed by an accelerator picture
gallery. The next unit is devoted to Python experiments looking at
histograms of Higgs Boson production with various forms of shape of
signal and various background and with various event totals. Then
random variables and some simple principles of statistics are
introduced with explanation as to why they are relevant to Physics
counting experiments. The unit introduces Gaussian (normal)
distributions and explains why they seen so often in natural
phenomena. Several Python illustrations are given. Random Numbers with
their Generators and Seeds lead to a discussion of Binomial and
Poisson Distribution. Monte-Carlo and accept-reject methods. The
Central Limit Theorem concludes discussion.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
This section covers 51 values of X and an overall study of Big data
that emerged from a NIST (National Institute for Standards and
Technology) study of Big data. The section covers the NIST Big Data
Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) Process and summarizes the work of five
subgroups: Definitions and Taxonomies Subgroup, Reference Architecture
Subgroup, Security and Privacy Subgroup, Technology Roadmap Subgroup
and the Requirements andUse Case Subgroup. 51 use cases collected in
this process are briefly discussed with a classification of the source
of parallelism and the high and low level computational structure. We
describe the key features of this classification. 
 

Unit 16 - Overview of NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) Process and Results 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Unit Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This unit covers the NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG)
Process and summarizes the work of five subgroups: Definitions and
Taxonomies Subgroup, Reference Architecture Subgroup, Security and

Lesson 1 - Introduction to NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
The focus of the (NBD-PWG) is to form a community of interest from
industry, academia, and government, with the goal of developing a
consensus definitions, taxonomies, secure reference architectures, and
technology roadmap. The aim is to create vendor-neutral, technology
and infrastructure agnostic deliverables to enable big data
stakeholders to pick-and-choose best analytics tools for their
processing and visualization requirements on the most suitable
computing platforms and clusters while allowing value-added from big
data service providers and flow of data between the stakeholders in a
cohesive and secure manner.

Video: http://youtu.be/ofRfHBKpyvg

 

Lesson 2 - Definitions and Taxonomies Subgroup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
The focus is to gain a better understanding of the principles of Big
Data. It is important to develop a consensus-based common language and
vocabulary terms used in Big Data across stakeholders from industry,
academia, and government. In addition, it is also critical to identify
essential actors with roles and responsibility, and subdivide them
into components and sub-components on how they interact/ relate with
each other according to their similarities and differences. 

For Definitions: Compile terms used from all stakeholders regarding
the meaning of Big Data from various standard bodies, domain
applications, and diversified operational environments. For
Taxonomies: Identify key actors with their roles and responsibilities
from all stakeholders, categorize them into components and
subcomponents based on their similarities and differences. In
particular data Science and Big Data terms are discussed.

Video: http://youtu.be/sGshHN-DdbE

Lesson 3 - Reference Architecture Subgroup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus-based approach
to orchestrate vendor-neutral, technology and infrastructure agnostic
for analytics tools and computing environments. The goal is to enable
Big Data stakeholders to pick-and-choose technology-agnostic analytics
tools for processing and visualization in any computing platform and
cluster while allowing value-added from Big Data service providers and
the flow of the data between the stakeholders in a cohesive and secure
manner. Results include a reference architecture with well defined
components and linkage as well as several exemplars.

Video: http://youtu.be/JV596ZH36YA
 

Lesson 4 - Security and Privacy Subgroup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus secure
reference architecture to handle security and privacy issues across
all stakeholders. This includes gaining an understanding of what
standards are available or under development, as well as identifies
which key organizations are working on these standards. The Top Ten
Big Data Security and Privacy Challenges from the CSA (Cloud Security
Alliance) BDWG are studied. Specialized use cases include
Retail/Marketing, Modern Day Consumerism, Nielsen Homescan, Web
Traffic Analysis, Healthcare, Health Information Exchange, Genetic
Privacy, Pharma Clinical Trial Data Sharing, Cyber-security,
Government, Military and Education. 

Video: http://youtu.be/Gbk0LaWE3lM

Lesson 5 - Technology Roadmap Subgroup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus vision with
recommendations on how Big Data should move forward by performing a
good gap analysis through the materials gathered from all other NBD
subgroups. This includes setting standardization and adoption
priorities through an understanding of what standards are available or
under development as part of the recommendations. Tasks are gather
input from NBD subgroups and study the taxonomies for the actors'
roles and responsibility, use cases and requirements, and secure
reference architecture; gain understanding of what standards are
available or under development for Big Data; perform a thorough gap
analysis and document the findings; identify what possible barriers
may delay or prevent adoption of Big Data; and document vision and
recommendations.

Video: http://youtu.be/GCc9yfErmd0

 

Lesson 6 - Requirements and Use Case Subgroup Introduction I
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 

The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus list of Big
Data requirements across all stakeholders. This includes gathering and
understanding various use cases from diversified application
domains.Tasks are gather use case input from all stakeholders; derive
Big Data requirements from each use case; analyze/prioritize a list of
challenging general requirements that may delay or prevent adoption of
Big Data deployment; develop a set of general patterns capturing the
''essence'' of use cases (not done yet) and work with Reference
Architecture to validate requirements and reference architecture by
explicitly implementing some patterns based on use cases. The progress
of gathering use cases (discussed in next two units) and requirements
systemization are discussed.

Section 8 - Technology Training - Plotviz 
======================================================================
 

 

Section Overview 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

We introduce Plotviz, a data visualization tool developed at
Indiana University to display 2 and 3 dimensional data. The motivation
is that the human eye is very good at pattern recognition and can
''see'' structure in data. Although most Big data is higher
dimensional than 3, all can be transformed by dimension reduction
techniques to 3D. He gives several examples to show how the software
can be used and what kind of data can be visualized. This includes
individual plots and the manipulation of multiple synchronized
plots.Finally, he describes the download and software dependency of
Plotviz.

Lesson 1 - Motivation and Introduction to use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The motivation of Plotviz is that the human eye is very good at
pattern recognition and can ''see'' structure in data. Although most
Big data is higher dimensional than 3, all data can be transformed by
dimension reduction techniques to 3D and one can check analysis like
clustering and/or see structure missed in a computer analysis. The
motivations shows some Cheminformatics examples. The use of Plotviz is
started in slide 4 with a discussion of input file which is either a
simple text or more features (like colors) can be specified in a rich
XML syntax. Plotviz deals with points and their classification
(clustering). Next the protein sequence browser in 3D shows the basic
structure of Plotviz interface. The next two slides explain the core
3D and 2D manipulations respectively. Note all files used in examples
are available to students.

Lesson 2 - Example of Use I: Cube and Structured Dataset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Initially we start with a simple plot of 8 points -- the corners of a
cube in 3 dimensions -- showing basic operations such as
size/color/labels and Legend of points. The second example shows a
dataset (coming from GTM dimension reduction) with significant
structure. This has .pviz and a .txt versions that are compared.

Video: http://youtu.be/nCTT5mI_j_Q
 

Lesson 3 - Example of Use II: Proteomics and Synchronized Rotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This starts with an examination of a sample of Protein Universe
Browser showing how one uses Plotviz to look at different features of
this set of Protein sequences projected to 3D. Then we show how to
compare two datasets with synchronized rotation of a dataset clustered
in 2 different ways; this dataset comes from k Nearest Neighbor
discussion.

Video: http://youtu.be/lDbIhnLrNkk

 

Lesson 4 - Example of Use III: More Features and larger Proteomics Sample
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
This starts by describing use of Labels and Glyphs and the Default
mode in Plotviz. Then we illustrate sophisticated use of these ideas
to view a large Proteomics dataset.

Video: http://youtu.be/KBkUW_QNSvs
 

Lesson 5 - Example of Use IV: Tools and Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
This lesson starts by describing the Plotviz tools and then sets up
two examples -- Oil Flow and Trading -- described in PowerPoint. It
finishes with the Plotviz viewing of Oil Flow data.

Video: http://youtu.be/zp_709imR40
 

Lesson 6 - Example of Use V: Final Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This starts with Plotviz looking at Trading example introduced in
previous lesson and then examines solvent data. It finishes with two
large biology examples with 446K and 100K points and each with over
100 clusters. We finish remarks on Plotviz software structure and how
to download. We also remind you that a picture is worth a 1000 words.

Section 9 - X= e-Commerce and LifeStyle Case Study 
======================================================================

Section Overview 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Recommender systems operate under the hood of such widely recognized
sites as Amazon, eBay, Monster and Netflix where everything is a
recommendation. This involves a symbiotic relationship between vendor
and buyer whereby the buyer provides the vendor with information about
their preferences, while the vendor then offers recommendations
tailored to match their needs. Kaggle competitions h improve the
success of the Netflix and other recommender systems. Attention is
paid to models that are used to compare how changes to the systems
affect their overall performance. It is interesting that the humble
ranking has become such a dominant driver of the world's economy. More
examples of recommender systems are given from Google News, Retail
stores and in depth Yahoo! covering the multi-faceted criteria used in
deciding recommendations on web sites. 

The formulation of recommendations in terms of points in a space or
bag is given where bags of item properties, user properties, rankings
and users are useful. Detail is given on basic principles behind
recommender systems: user-based collaborative filtering, which uses
similarities in user rankings to predict their interests, and the
Pearson correlation, used to statistically quantify correlations
between users viewed as points in a space of items. Items are viewed
as points in a space of users in item-based collaborative
filtering. The Cosine Similarity is introduced, the difference between
implicit and explicit ratings and the k Nearest Neighbors
algorithm. General features like the curse of dimensionality in high
dimensions are discussed. A simple Python k Nearest Neighbor code and
its application to an artificial data set in 3 dimensions is
given. Results are visualized in Matplotlib in 2D and with Plotviz in
3D. The concept of a training and a testing set are introduced with
training set pre labeled. Recommender system are used to discuss
clustering with k-means based clustering methods used and their
results examined in Plotviz. The original labelling is compared to
clustering results and extension to 28 clusters given. General issues
in clustering are discussed including local optima, the use of
annealing to avoid this and value of heuristic algorithms. 
 


 

Unit 20 - Recommender Systems: Introduction 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Unit Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We introduce Recommender systems as an optimization technology
used in a variety of applications and contexts online. They operate in
the background of such widely recognized sites as Amazon, eBay,
Monster and Netflix where everything is a recommendation. This
involves a symbiotic relationship between vendor and buyer whereby the
buyer provides the vendor with information about their preferences,
while the vendor then offers recommendations tailored to match their
needs, to the benefit of both. 

There follows an exploration of the Kaggle competition site, other
recommender systems and Netflix, as well as competitions held to
improve the success of the Netflix recommender system. Finally
attention is paid to models that are used to compare how changes to
the systems affect their overall performance. It is interesting how the
humble ranking has become such a dominant driver of the world's
economy.

Lesson 1 - Recommender Systems as an Optimization Problem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
We define a set of general recommender systems as matching of items to
people or perhaps collections of items to collections of people where
items can be other people, products in a store, movies, jobs, events,
web pages etc. We present this as "yet another optimization problem".

https://youtu.be/rymBt1kdyVU
 

Lesson 2 - Recommender Systems Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
We give a general discussion of recommender systems and point out that
they are particularly valuable in long tail of tems (to be
recommended) that aren't commonly known. We pose them as a rating
system and relate them to information retrieval rating systems. We can
contrast recommender systems based on user profile and context; the
most familiar collaborative filtering of others ranking; item
properties; knowledge and hybrid cases mixing some or all of these.

https://youtu.be/KbjBKrzFYKg
 

Lesson 3 - Kaggle Competitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We look at Kaggle competitions with examples from web site. In
particular we discuss an Irvine class project involving ranking jokes.

https://youtu.be/DFH7GPrbsJA

 

Lesson 4 - Examples of Recommender Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 

We go through a list of 9 recommender systems from the same Irvine
class.

https://youtu.be/1Eh1epQj-EQ
 

Lesson 5 - Netflix on Recommender Systems I
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
This is Part 1.

We summarize some interesting points from a tutorial from Netflix for
whom ''everything is a recommendation''. Rankings are given in
multiple categories and categories that reflect user interests are
especially important. Criteria used include explicit user preferences,
implicit based on ratings and hybrid methods as well as freshness and
diversity. Netflix tries to explain the rationale of its
recommendations. We give some data on Netflix operations and some
methods used in its recommender systems. We describe the famous
Netflix Kaggle competition to improve its rating system. The analogy
to maximizing click through rate is given and the objectives of
optimization are given.

This is Part 2 of "Netflix on Recommender Systems"

https://youtu.be/GnAol5aGuEo
 

Lesson 7 - Consumer Data Science
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Here we go through Netflix's methodology in letting data speak for
itself in optimizing the recommender engine. An example iis given on
choosing self produced movies. A/B testing is discussed with examples
showing how testing does allow optimizing of sophisticated
criteria. This lesson is concluded by comments on Netflix technology
and the full spectrum of issues that are involved including user
interface, data, AB testing, systems and architectures. We comment on
optimizing for a household rather than optimizing for individuals in
household.

Unit 21 - Recommender Systems: Examples and Algorithms 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Unit Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
We continue the discussion of recommender systems and their use in e-commerce. More examples are given from Google News, Retail stores and in depth Yahoo! covering the multi-faceted criteria used in deciding recommendations on web sites. Then the formulation of recommendations in terms of points in a space or bag is given.

Here bags of item properties, user properties, rankings and users are useful. Then we go into detail on basic principles behind recommender systems: user-based collaborative filtering, which uses similarities in user rankings to predict their interests, and the Pearson correlation, used to statistically quantify correlations between users viewed as points in a space of items.

Lesson 1 - Recap and Examples of Recommender Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We start with a quick recap of recommender systems from previous unit;
what they are with brief examples.

https://youtu.be/dcdm5AfGZ64

 

Lesson 2 - Examples of Recommender Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
We give 2 examples in more detail: namely Google News and Markdown in
Retail.

Lesson 3 - Recommender Systems in Yahoo Use Case Example I
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
This is Part 1.

We describe in greatest detail the methods used to optimize Yahoo web
sites. There are two lessons discussing general approach and a third
lesson examines a particular personalized Yahoo page with its
different components. We point out the different criteria that must be
blended in making decisions; these criteria include analysis of what
user does after a particular page is clicked; is the user satisfied
and cannot that we quantified by purchase decisions etc. We need to
choose Articles, ads, modules, movies, users, updates, etc to optimize
metrics such as relevance score, CTR, revenue, engagement.These lesson
stress that if though we have big data, the recommender data is
sparse. We discuss the approach that involves both batch (offline) and
on-line (real time) components.

Lesson 6 - User-based nearest-neighbor collaborative filtering I
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is Part 1.

Collaborative filtering is a core approach to recommender
systems. There is user-based and item-based collaborative filtering
and here we discuss the user-based case. Here similarities in user
rankings allow one to predict their interests, and typically this
quantified by the Pearson correlation, used to statistically quantify
correlations between users.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
We move on to item-based collaborative filtering where items
are viewed as points in a space of users. The Cosine Similarity is
introduced, the difference between implicit and explicit ratings and
the k Nearest Neighbors algorithm. General features like the curse of

Lesson 1 - Item-based Collaborative Filtering I
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
This is Part 1.

We covered user-based collaborative filtering in the previous
unit. Here we start by discussing memory-based real time and model
based offline (batch) approaches. Now we look at item-based
collaborative filtering where items are viewed in the space of users
and the cosine measure is used to quantify distances. WE discuss
optimizations and how batch processing can help. We discuss different
Likert ranking scales and issues with new items that do not have a
significant number of rankings.

Lesson 3 - k Nearest Neighbors and High Dimensional Spaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We define the k Nearest Neighbor algorithms and present the Python
software but do not use it. We give examples from Wikipedia and
describe performance issues. This algorithm illustrates the curse of
dimensionality. If items were a real vectors in a low dimension space,
there would be faster solution methods.

Lesson 1 - Python k'th Nearest Neighbor Algorithms I
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
This is Part 1.

This lesson considers the Python k Nearest Neighbor code found on the
web associated with a book by Harrington on Machine Learning. There
are two data sets. First we consider a set of 4 2D vectors divided
into two categories (clusters) and use k=3 Nearest Neighbor algorithm
to classify 3 test points. Second we consider a 3D dataset that has
already been classified and show how to normalize. In this lesson we
just use Matplotlib to give 2D plots.

Lesson 2 - Python k'th Nearest Neighbor Algorithms II
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
This is Part 2 of "Python k'th Nearest Neighbor Algorithms".

https://youtu.be/JK5p24mnTjs
 

Lesson 3 - 3D Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
The lesson modifies the online code to allow it to produce files
readable by PlotViz. We visualize already classified 3D set and rotate
in 3D.

https://youtu.be/fLtH-ZI1Jqk
 

Lesson 4 - Testing k'th Nearest Neighbor Algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The lesson goes through an example of using k NN classification
algorithm by dividing dataset into 2 subsets. One is training set with
initial classification; the other is test point to be classified by
k=3 NN using training set. The code records fraction of points with a
different classification from that input. One can experiment with
different sizes of the two subsets. The Python implementation of
algorithm is analyzed in detail.

Unit 24 - Clustering and heuristic methods 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Unit Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use example of recommender system to discuss clustering. The
details of methods are not discussed but k-means based clustering
methods are used and their results examined in Plotviz. The original
labelling is compared to clustering results and extension to 28
clusters given. General issues in clustering are discussed including
local optima, the use of annealing to avoid this and value of
heuristic algorithms.

Lesson 1 - Kmeans Clustering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
We introduce the k means algorithm in a gentle fashion and
describes its key features including dangers of local minima. A simple
example from Wikipedia is examined.

https://youtu.be/3KTNJ0Okrqs
 

Lesson 2 - Clustering of Recommender System Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Plotviz is used to examine and compare the original classification
with an ''optimal'' clustering into 3 clusters using a fancy
deterministic annealing method that is similar to k means. The new
clustering has centers marked.

https://youtu.be/yl_KZ86NT-A
 

Lesson 3 - Clustering of Recommender Example into more than 3 Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The previous division into 3 clusters is compared into a clustering
into 28 separate clusters that are naturally smaller in size and
divide 3D space covered by 1000 points into compact geometrically
local regions.

https://youtu.be/JWZmh48l0cw

 

Lesson 4 - Local Optima in Clustering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
This lesson introduces some general principles. First many important
processes are ''just'' optimization problems. Most such problems are
rife with local optima. The key idea behind annealing to avoid local
optima is described. The pervasive greedy optimization method is
described.

https://youtu.be/Zmq8O_axCmc
 

Lesson 5 - Clustering in General
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The two different applications of clustering are described. First find
geometrically distinct regions and secondly divide spaces into
geometrically compact regions that may have no ''thin air'' between
them. Generalizations such as mixture models and latent factor methods
are just mentioned. The important distinction between applications in
vector spaces and those where only inter-point distances are defined
is described. Examples are then given using PlotViz from 2D clustering
of a mass spectrometry example and the results of clustering genomic
data mapped into 3D with Multi Dimensional Scaling MDS.

Some remarks are given on heuristics; why are they so important why
getting exact answers is often not so important?

Section 11 - Cloud Computing Technology for Big Data Applications & Analytics (will be updated) 
======================================================================
 

 

Section Overview 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

We describe the central role of Parallel computing in Clouds and Big
Data which is decomposed into lots of ''Little data'' running in
individual cores. Many examples are given and it is stressed that
issues in parallel computing are seen in day to day life for
communication, synchronization, load balancing and
decomposition. Cyberinfrastructure for e-moreorlessanything or
moreorlessanything-Informatics and the basics of cloud computing are
introduced. This includes virtualization and the important ''as a
Service'' components and we go through several different definitions
of cloud computing. 

Gartner's Technology Landscape includes hype cycle and priority matrix
and covers clouds and Big Data. Two simple examples of the value of
clouds for enterprise applications are given with a review of
different views as to nature of Cloud Computing. This IaaS
(Infrastructure as a Service) discussion is followed by PaaS and SaaS
(Platform and Software as a Service). Features in Grid and cloud
computing and data are treated. We summarize the 21 layers and almost
300 software packages in the HPC-ABDS Software Stack explaining how
they are used. 

Cloud (Data Center) Architectures with physical setup, Green Computing
issues and software models are discussed followed by the Cloud
Industry stakeholders with a 2014 Gartner analysis of Cloud computing
providers. This is followed by applications on the cloud including
data intensive problems, comparison with high performance computing,
science clouds and the Internet of Things. Remarks on Security, Fault
Tolerance and Synchronicity issues in cloud follow. We describe the
way users and data interact with a cloud system. The Big Data
Processing from an application perspective with commercial examples
including eBay concludes section after a discussion of data system
architectures.

Lesson 1 - Decomposition I
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
This is Part 1.

We describe why parallel computing is essential with Big Data
and distinguishes parallelism over users to that over the data in
problem. The general ideas behind data decomposition are given
followed by a few often whimsical examples dreamed up 30 years ago in
the early heady days of parallel computing. These include scientific
simulations, defense outside missile attack and computer chess. The
basic problem of parallel computing -- efficient coordination of
separate tasks processing different data parts -- is described with
MPI and MapReduce as two approaches. The challenges of data
decomposition in irregular problems is noted.

Lesson 4 - Parallel Computing in Society I
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is Part 1.

This lesson from the past notes that one can view society as an
approach to parallel linkage of people. The largest example given is
that of the construction of a long wall such as that (Hadrian's wall)
between England and Scotland. Different approaches to parallelism are
given with formulae for the speed up and efficiency. The concepts of
grain size (size of problem tackled by an individual processor) and
coordination overhead are exemplified. This example also illustrates
Amdahl's law and the relation between data and processor topology. The
lesson concludes with other examples from nature including collections
of neurons (the brain) and ants.

Lesson 6 - Parallel Processing for Hadrian's Wall
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
This lesson returns to Hadrian's wall and uses it to illustrate
advanced issues in parallel computing. First We describe the
basic SPMD -- Single Program Multiple Data -- model. Then irregular
but homogeneous and heterogeneous problems are discussed. Static and
dynamic load balancing is needed. Inner parallelism (as in vector
instruction or the multiple fingers of masons) and outer parallelism
(typical data parallelism) are demonstrated. Parallel I/O for
Hadrian's wall is followed by a slide summarizing this quaint
comparison between Big data parallelism and the construction of a
large wall.

Lesson 1 - Cyberinfrastructure for E-MoreOrLessAnything
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This introduction describes Cyberinfrastructure or e-infrastructure
and its role in solving the electronic implementation of any problem
where e-moreorlessanything is another term for
moreorlessanything-Informatics and generalizes early discussion of
e-Science and e-Business.

Lesson 2 - What is Cloud Computing: Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Cloud Computing is introduced with an operational definition involving
virtualization and efficient large data centers that can rent
computers in an elastic fashion. The role of services is essential --
it underlies capabilities being offered in the cloud. The four basic
aaS's -- Software (SaaS), Platform (Paas), Infrastructure (IaaS) and
Network (NaaS) -- are introduced with Research aaS and other
capabilities (for example Sensors aaS are discussed later) being built
on top of these.

This section starts with an overview of data mining and puts our study
of classification, clustering and exploration methods in context. We
examine the problem to be solved in web and text search and note the
relevance of history with libraries, catalogs and concordances. An
overview of web search is given describing the continued evolution of
search engines and the relation to the field of Information
Retrieval. The importance of recall, precision and diversity is
discussed. The important Bag of Words model is introduced and both
Boolean queries and the more general fuzzy indices. The important
vector space model and revisiting the Cosine Similarity as a distance
in this bag follows. The basic TF-IDF approach is dis
cussed. Relevance is discussed with a probabilistic model while the
distinction between Bayesian and frequency views of probability
distribution completes this unit. 

We start with an overview of the different steps (data
analytics) in web search and then goes key steps in detail starting
with document preparation. An inverted index is described and then how
it is prepared for web search. The Boolean and Vector Space approach
to query processing follow. This is followed by Link Structure
Analysis including Hubs, Authorities and PageRank. The application of
PageRank ideas as reputation outside web search is covered. The web
graph structure, crawling it and issues in web advertising and search
follow. The use of clustering and topic models completes section


 

Unit 30 - Web Search and Text Mining I

mutual linkage of pages by URL's) and universal power laws for number
of pages with particular number of URL's linking out or in to
page. Information retrieval is introduced and compared to web
search. A comparison is given between semantic searches as in
databases and the full text search that is base of Web search. The
origin of web search in libraries, catalogs and concordances is
summarized. DIKW -- Data Information Knowledge Wisdom -- model for web
search is discussed. Then features of documents, collections and the
important Bag of Words representation. Queries are presented in
context of an Information Retrieval architecture. The method of
judging quality of results including recall, precision and diversity
is described. A time line for evolution of search engines is given. 

Boolean and Vector Space models for query including the cosine
similarity are introduced. Web Crawlers are discussed and then the
steps needed to analyze data from Web and produce a set of
terms. Building and accessing an inverted index is followed by the
importance of term specificity and how it is captured in TF-IDF. We
note how frequencies are converted into belief and relevance.

Section 13 - Technology for Big Data Applications and Analytics 
======================================================================
 

 

Section Overview 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 

We use the K-means Python code in SciPy package to show real
code for clustering. After a simple example we generate 4 clusters of
distinct centers and various choice for sizes using Matplotlib tor
visualization. We show results can sometimes be incorrect and
sometimes make different choices among comparable solutions. We
discuss the ''hill'' between different solutions and rationale for
running K-means many times and choosing best answer. Then we introduce
MapReduce with the basic architecture and a homely example. The
discussion of advanced topics includes an extension to Iterative
MapReduce from Indiana University called Twister and a generalized Map
Collective model. Some measurements of parallel performance are
given. The SciPy K-means code is modified to support a MapReduce
execution style. This illustrates the key ideas of mappers and
reducers. With appropriate runtime this code would run in parallel but
here the ''parallel'' maps run sequentially. This simple 2 map version
can be generalized to scalable parallelism. Python is used to
Calculate PageRank from Web Linkage Matrix showing several different
formulations of the basic matrix equations to finding leading
eigenvector. The unit is concluded by a calculation of PageRank for
general web pages by extracting the secret from Google.

Lesson 1 - K-means in Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use the K-means Python code in SciPy package to show real
code for clustering and applies it a set of 85 two dimensional vectors
-- officially sets of weights and heights to be clustered to find
T-shirt sizes. We run through Python code with Matplotlib displays to
divide into 2-5 clusters. Then we discuss Python to generate 4
clusters of varying sizes and centered at corners of a square in two
dimensions. We formally give the K means algorithm better than before
and make definition consistent with code in SciPy.

https://youtu.be/I79ISV6XBbE

 

Lesson 2 - Analysis of 4 Artificial Clusters I
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is Part 1.

We present clustering results on the artificial set of 1000 2D points
described in previous lesson for 3 choices of cluster sizes ''small''
''large'' and ''very large''. We emphasize the SciPy always does 20
independent K means and takes the best result -- an approach to
avoiding local minima. We allow this number of independent runs to be
changed and in particular set to 1 to generate more interesting
erratic results. We define changes in our new K means code that also
has two measures of quality allowed. The slides give many results of
clustering into 2 4 6 and 8 clusters (there were only 4 real
clusters). We show that the ''very small'' case has two very different
solutions when clustered into two clusters and use this to discuss
functions with multiple minima and a hill between them. The lesson has
both discussion of already produced results in slides and interactive
use of Python for new runs.

Unit 34 - Technology for X-Informatics: Kmeans and MapReduce Parallelism (Python & Java Track) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Unit Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
We modify the SciPy K-means code to support a MapReduce
execution style and runs it in this short unit. This illustrates the
key ideas of mappers and reducers. With appropriate runtime this code
would run in parallel but here the ''parallel'' maps run
sequentially. We stress that this simple 2 map version can be
generalized to scalable parallelism.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are predicted to be 24-50 Billion devices on the Internet by
2020; these are typically some sort of sensor defined as any source or
sink of time series data. Sensors include smartphones, webcams,
monitors of machine operation, barcodes, surveillance cameras,
scientific sensors (especially in earth and environmental science),
drones and self driving cars and more generally transportation
systems. The lesson gives many examples of distributed sensors, which
form a Grid that is controlled by a cloud.

Section 15 - X= Radar Case Study 
======================================================================
 

Unit 37 - X-Informatics Case Study: Radar 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Unit Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
The changing global climate is suspected to have long-term effects on
much of the world's inhabitants. Among the various effects, the rising
sea level will directly affect many people living in low-lying coastal
regions. While the ocean-s thermal expansion has been the dominant
contributor to rises in sea level, the potential contribution of
discharges from the polar ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica may
provide a more significant threat due to the unpredictable response to
the changing climate. The Radar-Informatics unit provides a glimpse in
the processes fueling global climate change and explains what methods
are used for ice data acquisitions and analysis.
