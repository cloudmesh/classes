Section 1 - Overview
======================================================================

This section has a technical overview of course followed by a broad
motivation for course.

The course overview covers it's content and structure. It presents the
X-Informatics fields (defined values of X) and the Rallying cry of
course: Use Clouds running Data Analytics Collaboratively processing
Big Data to solve problems in X-Informatics ( or e-X). The courses is
set up as a MOOC divided into units that vary in length but are
typically around an hour and those are further subdivided into 5-15
minute lessons.

The course covers a mix of applications (the X in X-Informatics) and
technologies needed to support the field electronically i.e. to
process the application data. The overview ends with a discussion of
course content at highest level. The course starts with a longish
Motivation unit summarizing clouds and data science, then units
describing applications (X = Physics, e-Commerce, Web Search and Text
mining, Health, Sensors and Remote Sensing). These are interspersed
with discussions of infrastructure (clouds) and data analytics
(algorithms like clustering and collaborative filtering used in
applications). The course uses either Python or Java and there are
Side MOOCs discussing Python and Java tracks.

The course motivation starts with striking examples of the data deluge
with examples from research, business and the consumer. The growing
number of jobs in data science is highlighted. He describes industry
trend in both clouds and big data. Then the cloud computing model
developed at amazing speed by industry is introduced. The 4 paradigms
of scientific research are described with growing importance of data
oriented version.He covers 3 major X-informatics areas: Physics,
e-Commerce and Web Search followed by a broad discussion of cloud
applications. Parallel computing in general and particular features of
MapReduce are described. He comments on a data science education and
the benefits of using MOOC's.

Jobs abound in clouds and data science. There are documented shortages
in data science, computer science and the major tech companies
advertise for new talent.

http://youtu.be/h9u7YeKkHHU
 

Lesson 4 - Industrial Trends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 

Trends include the growing importance of mobile devices and
comparative decrease in desktop access, the export of internet
content, the change in dominant client operating systems, use of
social media, thriving chinese internet companies.

http://youtu.be/EIRIPDYN5nM

Lesson 5 - Digital Disruption of Old Favorites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not everything goes up. The rise of the Internet has led to declines
in some traditional areas including Shopping malls and Postal
Services.

http://youtu.be/RxGopRuMWOE

 

Lesson 6 - Computing Model: Industry adopted clouds which are attractive for data analytics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clouds and Big Data are transformational on a 2-5 year time scale.
Already Amazon AWS is a lucrative business with almost a $4B revenue.
We describe the nature of cloud centers with economies of scale
and gives examples of importance of virtualization in server
consolidation. Then key characteristics of clouds are reviewed with
expected high growth in Infrastructure, Platform and Software as a
Service.

http://youtu.be/NBZPQqXKbiw


 

Lesson 7 - Research Model: 4th Paradigm; From Theory to Data driven science?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
We introduce the 4 paradigms of scientific research with the
focus on the new fourth data driven methodology.

http://youtu.be/2ke459BRBhw
 

Lesson 8 - Data Science Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 

We introduce the DIKW data to information to knowledge to
wisdom paradigm. Data flows through cloud services transforming itself
and emerging as new information to input into other transformations.

http://youtu.be/j9ytOaBoe2k

Lesson 9 - Physics-Informatics Looking for Higgs Particle with Large Hadron Collider LHC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
We look at important particle physics example where the Large
hadron Collider has observed the Higgs Boson. He shows this discovery
as a bump in a histogram; something that so amazed him 50 years ago
that he got a PhD in this field. He left field partly due to the
incredible size of author lists on papers.

http://youtu.be/qUB0q4AOavY
 

Lesson 10 - Recommender Systems I
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many important applications involve matching users, web pages, jobs,
movies, books, events etc. These are all optimization problems with
recommender systems one important way of performing this optimization.
We go through the example of Netflix -- everything is a
recommendation and muses about the power of viewing all sorts of
things as items in a bag or more abstractly some space with funny
properties.

http://youtu.be/Aj5k0Sa7XGQ

 

Lesson 11 - Recommender Systems II
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Many important applications involve matching users, web pages, jobs,
movies, books, events etc. These are all optimization problems with
recommender systems one important way of performing this optimization.
We go through the example of Netflix -- everything is a
recommendation and muses about the power of viewing all sorts of
things as items in a bag or more abstractly some space with funny
properties.

http://youtu.be/VHS7il5OdjM


 

Lesson 12 - Web Search and Information Retrieval
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 

This course also looks at Web Search and here we give an
overview of the data analytics for web search, Pagerank as a method of
ranking web pages returned and uses material from Yahoo on the subtle
algorithms for dynamic personalized choice of material for web pages.

http://youtu.be/i9gR9PdVXUU
 

Lesson 13 - Cloud Application in Research
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
We describe scientific applications and how they map onto
clouds, supercomputers, grids and high throughput systems. He likes
the cloud use of the Internet of Things and gives examples.

http://youtu.be/C19-5WQH2TU
 

Lesson 14 - Parallel Computing and MapReduce
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
We define MapReduce and gives a homely example from fruit
blending.

http://youtu.be/BbW1PFNnKrE
 

Lesson 15 - Data Science Education
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
We discuss one reason you are taking this course -- Data
Science as an educational initiative and aspects of its Indiana
University implementation. Then general; features of online education
are discussed with clear growth spearheaded by MOOC's where we 
use this course and others as an example. He stresses the choice
between one class to 100,000 students or 2,000 classes to 50 students
and an online library of MOOC lessons. In olden days he suggested
''hermit's cage virtual university'' -- gurus in isolated caves
putting together exciting curricula outside the traditional university
model. Grading and mentoring models and important online tools are
discussed. Clouds have MOOC's describing them and MOOC's are stored in
clouds; a pleasing symmetry.

http://youtu.be/x2LuiX8DYLs


 

Lesson 16 - Conclusions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
The conclusions highlight clouds, data-intensive methodology,
employment, data science, MOOC's and never forget the Big Data
ecosystem in one sentence "Use Clouds running Data Analytics
Collaboratively processing Big Data to solve problems in X-Informatics
educated in data science"

Section 2 - Overview of Data Science: What is Big Data, Data Analytics and X-Informatics? 
===============================================================================================
 


 Section Overview 
-----------------------------------------------------------

The course introduction starts with X-Informatics and its rallying
cry. The growing number of jobs in data science is highlighted. The
first unit offers a look at the phenomenon described as the Data
Deluge starting with its broad features. Data science and the famous
DIKW (Data to Information to Knowledge to Wisdom) pipeline are
covered. Then more detail is given on the flood of data from Internet
and Industry applications with eBay and General Electric discussed in
most detail.

In the next unit, we continue the discussion of the data deluge
with a focus on scientific research. He takes a first peek at data
from the Large Hadron Collider considered later as physics Informatics
and gives some biology examples. He discusses the implication of data
for the scientific method which is changing with the data-intensive
methodology joining observation, theory and simulation as basic
methods. Two broad classes of data are the long tail of sciences: many
users with individually modest data adding up to a lot; and a myriad
of Internet connected devices -- the Internet of Things.

We give an initial technical overview of cloud computing as
pioneered by companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft with new
centers holding up to a million servers. The benefits of Clouds in
terms of power consumption and the environment are also touched upon,
followed by a list of the most critical features of Cloud computing
with a comparison to supercomputing. Features of the data deluge are
discussed with a salutary example where more data did better than more
thought. Then comes Data science and one part of it -- data analytics
-- the large algorithms that crunch the big data to give big wisdom.
There are many ways to describe data science and several are discussed
to give a good composite picture of this emerging field.

 Unit 4 - Part II: Data Deluge and Scientific Applications and Methodology 
-----------------------------------------------------------
 

Unit Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 

We continue the discussion of the data deluge with a focus on
scientific research. He takes a first peek at data from the Large
Hadron Collider considered later as physics Informatics and gives some
biology examples. He discusses the implication of data for the
scientific method which is changing with the data-intensive
methodology joining observation, theory and simulation as basic
methods. We discuss the long tail of sciences; many users with
individually modest data adding up to a lot. The last lesson
emphasizes how everyday devices -- the Internet of Things -- are being
used to create a wealth of data.

itself some 25 years ago.

http://youtu.be/srEbOAmU_g8

 

Lesson 4 - Long Tail of Science
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
There is big science such as particle physics where a single
experiment has 3000 people collaborate!.Then there are individual
investigators who don't generate a lot of data each but together they
add up to Big data.

http://youtu.be/dwzEKEGYhqE
 

Lesson 5 - Internet of Things
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
A final category of Big data comes from the Internet of Things where
lots of small devices -- smart phones, web cams, video games collect
and disseminate data and are controlled and coordinated in the cloud.

 Section 3 - X= Health Informatics Case Study 
===================================================

 

 

Section Overview 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 

This section starts by discussing general aspects of Big Data and
Health including data sizes, different areas including genomics, EBI,
radiology and the Quantified Self movement. We review current state of
health care and trends associated with it including increased use of
Telemedicine. We summarize an industry survey by GE and Accenture and
an impressive exemplar Cloud-based medicine system from Potsdam. We
give some details of big data in medicine. Some remarks on Cloud
computing and Health focus on security and privacy issues.

We survey an April 2013 McKinsey report on the Big Data revolution in
US health care; a Microsoft report in this area and a European Union
report on how Big Data will allow patient centered care in the future.
Examples are given of the Internet of Things, which will have great
impact on health including wearables. A study looks at 4 scenarios for
healthcare in 2032. Two are positive, one middle of the road and one
negative. The final topic is Genomics, Proteomics and Information
Visualization.

Lesson 13 - Genomics, Proteomics and Information Visualization I
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
A study of an Azure application with an Excel frontend and a cloud
BLAST backend starts this lesson. This is followed by a big data
analysis of personal genomics and an analysis of a typical DNA
sequencing analytics pipeline. The Protein Sequence Universe is
defined and used to motivate Multi dimensional Scaling MDS. Sammon's
method is defined and its use illustrated by a metagenomics example.
Subtleties in use of MDS include a monotonic mapping of the
dissimilarity function. The application to the COG Proteomics dataset
is discussed. We note that the MDS approach is related to the well
known chisq method and some aspects of nonlinear minimization of chisq
(Least Squares) are discussed.

http://youtu.be/r1yENstaAUE
 

Lesson 14 - Genomics, Proteomics and Information Visualization II
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This lesson continues the discussion of the COG Protein Universe
introduced in the last lesson. It is shown how Proteomics clusters are
clearly seen in the Universe browser. This motivates a side remark on
different clustering methods applied to metagenomics. Then we discuss
the Generative Topographic Map GTM method that can be used in
dimension reduction when original data is in a metric space and is in
this case faster than MDS as GTM computational complexity scales like
N not N squared as seen in MDS. 

Examples are given of GTM including an application to topic models in
Information Retrieval. Indiana University has developed a
deterministic annealing improvement of GTM. 3 separate clusterings are
projected for visualization and show very different structure
emphasizing the importance of visualizing results of data analytics.
The final slide shows an application of MDS to generate and visualize
phylogenetic trees.

Sports sees significant growth in analytics with pervasive statistics
shifting to more sophisticated measures. We start with baseball as
game is built around segments dominated by individuals where detailed
(video/image) achievement measures including PITCHf/x and FIELDf/x are
moving field into big data arena. There are interesting relationships
between the economics of sports and big data analytics. We look at
Wearables and consumer sports/recreation. The importance of spatial
visualization is discussed. We look at other Sports: Soccer, Olympics,
NFL Football, Basketball, Tennis and Horse Racing. 
 

Unit 7 - Sports Informatics I : Sabermetrics (Basic) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 

Unit Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
This unit discusses baseball starting with the movie Moneyball and the
2002-2003 Oakland Athletics. Unlike sports like basketball and soccer,
most baseball action is built around individuals often interacting in
pairs. This is much easier to quantify than many player phenomena in
other sports. We discuss Performance-Dollar relationship including new
stadiums and media/advertising. We look at classic baseball averages
and sophisticated measures like Wins Above Replacement.

 Section 5 - Technology Training - Python & FutureSystems (will be updated) 
======================================================================
 

 

Section Overview 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This section is meant to give an overview of the python tools needed
for doing for this course. These are really powerful tools which every
data scientist who wishes to use python must know. This section
covers. Canopy - Its is an IDE for python developed by EnThoughts. The
aim of this IDE is to bring the various python libraries under one
single framework or ''Canopy'' - that is why the name. NumPy - It is
popular library on top of which many other libraries (like pandas,
scipy) are built. It provides a way a vectorizing data. This helps to
organize in a more intuitive fashion and also helps us use the various
matrix operations which are popularly used by the machine learning
community. Matplotlib: This a data visualization package. It allows
you to create graphs charts and other such diagrams. It supports
Images in JPEG, GIF, TIFF format. SciPy: SciPy is a library built
above numpy and has a number of off the shelf algorithms / operations
implemented. These include algorithms from calculus(like integration),
statistics, linear algebra, image-processing, signal processing,
machine learning, etc.

Section 6 - X= Physics Case Study 
======================================================================
 

 

Section Overview 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
This section starts by describing the LHC accelerator at CERN and evidence found by the experiments suggesting existence of a Higgs Boson. The huge number of authors on a paper, remarks on histograms and Feynman diagrams is followed by an accelerator picture gallery. The next unit is devoted to Python experiments looking at histograms of Higgs Boson production with various forms of shape of signal and various background and with various event totals. Then random variables and some simple principles of statistics are introduced with explanation as to why they are relevant to Physics counting experiments. The unit introduces Gaussian (normal) distributions and explains why they seen so often in natural phenomena. Several Python illustrations are given. Random Numbers with their Generators and Seeds lead to a discussion of Binomial and Poisson Distribution. Monte-Carlo and accept-reject methods. The Central Limit Theorem concludes discussion.

Section 7 - Big Data Use Cases Survey 
======================================================================
 

 

Section Overview 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
This section covers 51 values of X and an overall study of Big data
that emerged from a NIST (National Institute for Standards and
Technology) study of Big data. The section covers the NIST Big Data
Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) Process and summarizes the work of five
subgroups: Definitions and Taxonomies Subgroup, Reference Architecture
Subgroup, Security and Privacy Subgroup, Technology Roadmap Subgroup
and the Requirements andUse Case Subgroup. 51 use cases collected in
this process are briefly discussed with a classification of the source
of parallelism and the high and low level computational structure. We
describe the key features of this classification. 
 

Unit 16 - Overview of NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) Process and Results 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Unit Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This unit covers the NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG)
Process and summarizes the work of five subgroups: Definitions and
Taxonomies Subgroup, Reference Architecture Subgroup, Security and
Privacy Subgroup, Technology Roadmap Subgroup and the Requirements and
Use Case Subgroup. The work of latter is continued in next two units.

Lesson 1 - Introduction to NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
The focus of the (NBD-PWG) is to form a community of interest from
industry, academia, and government, with the goal of developing a
consensus definitions, taxonomies, secure reference architectures, and
technology roadmap. The aim is to create vendor-neutral, technology
and infrastructure agnostic deliverables to enable big data
stakeholders to pick-and-choose best analytics tools for their
processing and visualization requirements on the most suitable
computing platforms and clusters while allowing value-added from big
data service providers and flow of data between the stakeholders in a
cohesive and secure manner.

http://youtu.be/ofRfHBKpyvg

 

Lesson 2 - Definitions and Taxonomies Subgroup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
The focus is to gain a better understanding of the principles of Big
Data. It is important to develop a consensus-based common language and
vocabulary terms used in Big Data across stakeholders from industry,
academia, and government. In addition, it is also critical to identify
essential actors with roles and responsibility, and subdivide them
into components and sub-components on how they interact/ relate with
each other according to their similarities and differences. 

For Definitions: Compile terms used from all stakeholders regarding
the meaning of Big Data from various standard bodies, domain
applications, and diversified operational environments. For
Taxonomies: Identify key actors with their roles and responsibilities
from all stakeholders, categorize them into components and
subcomponents based on their similarities and differences. In
particular data Science and Big Data terms are discussed.

http://youtu.be/sGshHN-DdbE

Lesson 3 - Reference Architecture Subgroup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus-based approach
to orchestrate vendor-neutral, technology and infrastructure agnostic
for analytics tools and computing environments. The goal is to enable
Big Data stakeholders to pick-and-choose technology-agnostic analytics
tools for processing and visualization in any computing platform and
cluster while allowing value-added from Big Data service providers and
the flow of the data between the stakeholders in a cohesive and secure
manner. Results include a reference architecture with well defined
components and linkage as well as several exemplars.

http://youtu.be/JV596ZH36YA
 

Lesson 4 - Security and Privacy Subgroup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus secure
reference architecture to handle security and privacy issues across
all stakeholders. This includes gaining an understanding of what
standards are available or under development, as well as identifies
which key organizations are working on these standards. The Top Ten
Big Data Security and Privacy Challenges from the CSA (Cloud Security
Alliance) BDWG are studied. Specialized use cases include
Retail/Marketing, Modern Day Consumerism, Nielsen Homescan, Web
Traffic Analysis, Healthcare, Health Information Exchange, Genetic
Privacy, Pharma Clinical Trial Data Sharing, Cyber-security,
Government, Military and Education. 

http://youtu.be/Gbk0LaWE3lM

Lesson 5 - Technology Roadmap Subgroup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus vision with
recommendations on how Big Data should move forward by performing a
good gap analysis through the materials gathered from all other NBD
subgroups. This includes setting standardization and adoption
priorities through an understanding of what standards are available or
under development as part of the recommendations. Tasks are gather
input from NBD subgroups and study the taxonomies for the actors'
roles and responsibility, use cases and requirements, and secure
reference architecture; gain understanding of what standards are
available or under development for Big Data; perform a thorough gap
analysis and document the findings; identify what possible barriers
may delay or prevent adoption of Big Data; and document vision and
recommendations.

http://youtu.be/GCc9yfErmd0

 

Lesson 6 - Requirements and Use Case Subgroup Introduction I
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 

The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus list of Big
Data requirements across all stakeholders. This includes gathering and
understanding various use cases from diversified application
domains.Tasks are gather use case input from all stakeholders; derive
Big Data requirements from each use case; analyze/prioritize a list of
challenging general requirements that may delay or prevent adoption of
Big Data deployment; develop a set of general patterns capturing the
''essence'' of use cases (not done yet) and work with Reference
Architecture to validate requirements and reference architecture by
explicitly implementing some patterns based on use cases. The progress
of gathering use cases (discussed in next two units) and requirements
systemization are discussed.

Section 8 - Technology Training - Plotviz 
======================================================================
 

 

Section Overview 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

We introduce Plotviz, a data visualization tool developed at
Indiana University to display 2 and 3 dimensional data. The motivation
is that the human eye is very good at pattern recognition and can
''see'' structure in data. Although most Big data is higher
dimensional than 3, all can be transformed by dimension reduction
techniques to 3D. He gives several examples to show how the software
can be used and what kind of data can be visualized. This includes
individual plots and the manipulation of multiple synchronized
plots.Finally, he describes the download and software dependency of
Plotviz.

Lesson 1 - Motivation and Introduction to use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The motivation of Plotviz is that the human eye is very good at
pattern recognition and can ''see'' structure in data. Although most
Big data is higher dimensional than 3, all data can be transformed by
dimension reduction techniques to 3D and one can check analysis like
clustering and/or see structure missed in a computer analysis. The
motivations shows some Cheminformatics examples. The use of Plotviz is
started in slide 4 with a discussion of input file which is either a
simple text or more features (like colors) can be specified in a rich
XML syntax. Plotviz deals with points and their classification
(clustering). Next the protein sequence browser in 3D shows the basic
structure of Plotviz interface. The next two slides explain the core
3D and 2D manipulations respectively. Note all files used in examples
are available to students.

Lesson 2 - Example of Use I: Cube and Structured Dataset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Initially we start with a simple plot of 8 points -- the corners of a
cube in 3 dimensions -- showing basic operations such as
size/color/labels and Legend of points. The second example shows a
dataset (coming from GTM dimension reduction) with significant
structure. This has .pviz and a .txt versions that are compared.

Lesson 3 - Example of Use II: Proteomics and Synchronized Rotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This starts with an examination of a sample of Protein Universe
Browser showing how one uses Plotviz to look at different features of
this set of Protein sequences projected to 3D. Then we show how to
compare two datasets with synchronized rotation of a dataset clustered
in 2 different ways; this dataset comes from k Nearest Neighbor
discussion.

Lesson 4 - Example of Use III: More Features and larger Proteomics Sample
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
This starts by describing use of Labels and Glyphs and the Default
mode in Plotviz. Then we illustrate sophisticated use of these ideas
to view a large Proteomics dataset.

http://youtu.be/KBkUW_QNSvs
 

Lesson 5 - Example of Use IV: Tools and Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
This lesson starts by describing the Plotviz tools and then sets up
two examples -- Oil Flow and Trading -- described in PowerPoint. It
finishes with the Plotviz viewing of Oil Flow data.

http://youtu.be/zp_709imR40
 

Lesson 6 - Example of Use V: Final Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This starts with Plotviz looking at Trading example introduced in
previous lesson and then examines solvent data. It finishes with two
large biology examples with 446K and 100K points and each with over
100 clusters. We finish remarks on Plotviz software structure and how
to download. We also remind you that a picture is worth a 1000 words.
