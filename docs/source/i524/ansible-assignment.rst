Ansible Assignment
==================

In this assignment you will use Ansible Galaxy to set up Emacs in a
cluster environment. Before you do the exercise, please familiarize
yourself with the Ansible lessons we have prepared:

* :doc:`Ansible I: Basic Example <../lesson/devops/ansible/ansible-I>`
* :doc:`Ansible II: Roles <../lesson/devops/ansible/ansible-II>`
* :doc:`Ansible III: Ansible Galaxy <../lesson/devops/ansible/ansible-III>`
* (Optional) :doc:`Ansible Example: A Playbook for MongoDB <../lesson/devops/ansible/ansible-appending>`

Assignment
----------

* Use the updated ``setup`` script and the ``galaxy`` directory in the
  `class assignment repository
  <https://github.com/cloudmesh/sp17-i524>`_.
* Set up the project structure similar to Ansible Galaxy example.
* Install Emacs from the package manager (apt in this class)

Submission
----------

* For **residential students**, please have this ready on your GitHub
  accounts by class time on Monday, March 6th. We will pick students
  at random to demonstrate their solutions.

* For **online students**, you don't need to submit anything to
  us. However, we still strongly encourage you to do this
  exercise. You need to understand how to use Ansible for the project,
  and to better understand the cloudmesh commands we will introduce
  next. If you encounter any difficulties, please post on Piazza or
  talk to the AIs during office hours. Please, plan to have this
  completed by March 27th.
