Python Homework
===============
   
In this homework you need to complete a few simple Python
exercises. Before you begin, please refer to the Python lessons on the
course website:

#. :doc:`Python Introduction <../lesson/prg/python_intro>`
#. :doc:`Python for Big Data <../lesson/prg/python_big_data>`
#. :doc:`Python cmd module <../lesson/prg/python_cmd>`      

Exercise 1
----------

Finish implementing the `Calculator` class by adding `multiply` and
`divide` methods.

Exercise 2
----------

Create a command-line interpreter, `mycmd`, that has the following
commands:

#. deploy
#. kill
#. benchmark
#. report

Each command should simply print out its name to the screen.

Exercise 3
----------

In the :doc:`tutorial on Python for big data
<../lesson/prg/python_big_data>`, you saw how to plot a histogram of
the ages of people who received traffic citations in Q1 2016. Generate
the same histogram with the `pygal <http://pygal.org/en/stable/>`_
Python module.

Submission
----------

* For **residential students**, please have this ready on your GitHub
  accounts by class time on Monday, February 20th. We will pick
  students at random to demonstrate their solutions.

* For **online students**, you don't need to submit anything to
  us. However, we still strongly encourage you to do these
  exercises. They will help you get up to speed in Python if you're
  not familiar with it; or if you are, they might introduce you to
  some modules that you haven't used before. Of course, if you have
  any questions about the exercises, please discuss them with the AIs
  during office hours or on Piazza.
