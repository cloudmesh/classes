It is normal that questions posed by the students in the
online and residential classes lead to improvements and clarifications
of the content published on the class Web pages. Hence you need to
revisit the page updates. Just as in other years we provide a
changelog. Changes will not lead to any requirements change to the class
but only improving the content. However, we have learned from previous
classes that additional homework may need to be added in case the
class participants need to grasp a concept better or simplify their
work.

We have two ways of providing content to the class:

* we release content only on weekly basis
* we release content even in draft form

We decided to do the later so you may have the ability to see what is
comming up. Please do not mistake this as a changing requirement. This
is an opportunity for you. You are not required to look at lectures or
assignments that are not yet released for this class.
