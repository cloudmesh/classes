Conventions
===========

`$`
    When showing examples of commands, the `$` symbol precedes the
    actual command. So, the other lines are the output obtained after
    executing the command. An example invoking the ls command
    follows::

       $ ls

`PORTALNAME`
    In some examples we refer to your portal name as the `PORTALNAME`
    you have on FutureSystems.

`USERNAME`
    In some examples we refer to your local computers name as
    `USERNAME`. Your portal name and your local name may be
    different.
