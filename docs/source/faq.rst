FAQ

How do I ask a question?
------------------------

We are using piazza for asking question. Our intend is to first gather
the answer on piazza and than move the answer in some form to the web
page if appropriate.

However asking a quaestion may require some effort on your part.

We suggest the following

* Before asking the quetion look at the Class Web site and in
  piazza. Both have search functions that you can use.
* Do not burry your question in an unrelated post. INstead use the
  **New Post** button
* Provide enough information in the questions. THis may include:

  * yur name
  * your HID
  * the exact URL where the issue aooruce (if related to the Web page
    or piaza)
  * detailed description of what the error is about
  * Make use of the online sessions so you can demonstrate the issue
    if it complicated to describe

What are the prerequisites for this class?
------------------------------------------

We have communicated the prerequisites to the university, but they may
have forgotten to add them to the class.  The perquisites can be found
in the appropriate class overview. Please review them carefully.

See:

* I524 :ref:`ref-i524-prerequisits`

Why is this class not hosted on EdX?
------------------------------------

I523 and I524 were the first classes hosted on EdX. We wanted to
continue offering them on EdX. However, the university system
administrators mentioned to us that their systems are not ready to
support this class in EdX. Unfortunately, this is out of our control
and we hope that the university will soon update to an EdX system that
can host our classes.

Why are you not using CANVAS for communicating with students?
-------------------------------------------------------------

We have found that Piazza supports our needs for communication better than Canvas.

Why are you using github for submitting projects and papers?
------------------------------------------------------------

This class is about open source technology and we like that you benefit
from material others in the class are developing or have developed. All
assignments are openly submitted to the class github for everyone to
see. As part of the goal of this class is to develop reusable
deployments. Such reuse is only possible if the code is publicly
available and others can benefit from it.

The technology papers are made accessible so you can read other
technology papers and can get an introduction in technologies that you
may not yet know about. It also allows others to contribute to your
technology papers and improve them.


I am full time student at IUPUI. Can I take the online version?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Yes you can.

If you are an international student, I suggest you verify this with
the office and the registrar. There may be some restrictions for
international students. Also some degree programs may have a limit or
do not allow to take online classes. It will be up to you to verify
the requirements with the appropriate administrators.

I am a residential student at IU. Can I take the online version only?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We recommend you take the residential class.

If you are an international student or a student of a particular
degree program restrictions may be placed in if and how many online
courses you can take. It will be up to you to contact the appropriate
administrative departments including the international student office
to verify what is allowed for you. In general international students
have such restrictions. Please find out what they are and which
section of the course is appropriate for you. 

The class is full what do I do?
-------------------------------

#. Make sure to put yourself on the waiting list.
#. If you are a residential student show up on the first class in the
   specified lecture room. More likely than not some students will
   enroll in more classes than they can do and places will free up. We
   will create a list and discuss with the registrar what to do.
   
Do I need to buy a textbook?
----------------------------

No, the resources will be provided for every unit. However, we
recommend that you identify useful books for the class that can help
you. Examples include

#. “Taming The Big Data Tidal Wave: Finding Opportunities in Huge Data
   Streams with Advanced Analytics”, Bill Franks Wiley ISBN:
   978-1-118-20878-6
#. “Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline”, Cathy O'Neil,
   Rachel Schutt, O'Reilly Media, ISBN 978-1449358655

If you find good books, we like to add them here.
   
Why is there no textbook?
-------------------------

We cover a wide range of topics and their subject-matter is constantly
undergoing changes. A textbook would be out of date by the time of
publishing.

Do I need a computer to participate in this class?
--------------------------------------------------

If you are an online student you need access to a computer. If you
are a residential student the facilities provided by SOIC will be
sufficient. However, as you study involves computers, its probably
important to evaluate if a computer will make your work easier. 

If it comes to what computer to buy we really do not have a good
recommendation as this depends on your budget. A computer running
Linux or OSX makes programming probably easier. A windows computer has
the advantage of also being able to run Word and ppt (so does OSX). A
cheap machine with multiple cores and sufficient memory (16GB+) is a
good idea. A SSD will make access to data especially if large data
snappy.

For this reason I myself use a Mac, but you probably can get much
cheaper machines with similar specs elsewhere.

Other students bought themselves a cheap computer and installed Linux
on it so they do not interfere with their work machines or with
Windows. Given how inexpensive computers these days are this may be a
reasonable idea. However, do not go too cheap have enough memory and
use an SSD if you can.

Which bibliography manager is required for the class?
-----------------------------------------------------

We require you use jabref:

How many hours will this course take to work on every week?
-----------------------------------------------------------

This question can not rely be answered precisely. Typically we have
2-3 hours video per week. However starting from that its difficult to
put a real number down as things may also depend on your background.

* The programming load is modest, but requires knowledge in python and
  linux systems which you may have to learn outside of this class.

* Some students have more experience than others, thus it may be
  possible to put in 6 hours per week overall, but other may have to
  put in 12 hours, while yet others may enjoy this class so much that
  they spend a lot more hours.

* We will certainly not stopping you form spending time in the class.
  It will be up to you to figure out how much time you will spend.

* Please remember that procrastination will not pay of in this class.
  
* The project or term paper will take a significant amount of time.

Is all classes material final?
------------------------------

No. Class material can change. Please remember that in a normal class
you will be given several hours of lectures a week. They will be
released on a weekly basis. What we do here is to release the material
as much as possible upfront and **correct** them when we find it
necessary to provide improvements or additions. Additionally, we
integrate your feedback into the classes. If you find errors on the
class Web page or have additions that you want to add, we would like
to hear from you. Pull requests can be issued by you so your
contributions get acknowledged and rewarded as part of the grade.

What are the changes to the web page?
-------------------------------------

The changes we make are typically fixing errata or clarification of
content. We do attempt to indicate when major change is made.

What lectures should I learn when?
----------------------------------

The class is structured in lectures that you can listen to at any
time. If you have difficulties with organizing your own calendar, we
will develop a sample calendar for you. Please contact us. However we
have undergraduates, graduates, residential and online students. We
even have students that can only work part of the semester while they
use their vacation. Hence, it is impossible for us to provide an exact
calendar that satisfies all the different types of students. Hence we
appeal to your organizational skills to create a "study" plan for you
during the first week of the semester that works for you.

We recommend to do the theory lectures as quickly as possible, but
also start learning ansible at the same time as this will be part of
your project. You will fail if you assume you can do the project in 2
weeks. You will need to work on it all semester long on weekly basis,
starting with learning how to use ansible and cloud resources.

I524: Why are you doing the papers?
-----------------------------------

Part of doing research is to communicate your thoughts on topics and
to be able to analyze and evaluate technologies that may or may not be
useful for you. Our goal within this class is for the first time to
gather a significant portion of the technologies that you hear about
in class and that you get exposed to as part of the technology list
into a "proceedings" developed by all students in class. The papers
serve also the dual purpose of you learning how to write a paper and
use bibliographies.

I524: Why are there no homework to test me on skills such as ansible or python?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We used to do smaller homework in previous classes to evaluate you on
your skills. However we found that they did not reflect real-world use
cases. By focusing on the project instead, you will be forced to
develop these skills.

However, we can provide you with additional ungraded homework that you
can conduct to test your skills if you like. Please let us know if you
like to do that and we can assign such homework to you.

I524: Why not use chef or another DevOps framework?
---------------------------------------------------

We used to use chef and other DevOps frameworks. However we found that
for a class grading can not be uniformly conducted while using too
many frameworks. We also found that the value of learning on how to
collaboratively contribute as part of an opensource class was
diminished while a small group were choosing other technologies. These
groups complained later on that they had too much work and could not
benefit from other students. Hence we make is simple. All DevOps must
be provided in ansible. All programming must be provided in python if
not an explicit reason exist to use another language or technology
such as R or technologies such as neo4j. However all deployment must
be done in python and ansible.

I am lost?
----------

Please contact the instructors for your class.

I do not like Technology/Topic/Project/etc?
-------------------------------------------

Please contact the instructors for your class.

I am not able to attend the online hours
----------------------------------------

Typically we provide many different times for meetings via Zoom. We
even schedule within reason special sessions. All of them are however
during reasonable hours in United States Easter Standard Time.

Do I need to attend the online sessions?
----------------------------------------

No. But you can ask any question you want. We found that in previous
classes that some students clearly benefitted from online sessions.
If you attend them make sure you have a working and tested microphone
if possible.

What are the leaning outcomes?
------------------------------

If you feel that they are not clearly stated as part of the course
please contact us so that we can clarify the material.


There are so many messages on Piazza I can not keep up.
-------------------------------------------------------

Residential students typically participate in live lectures in which
we discuss with each other important aspects of a topic. As an online
class may not have such a lecture, the piazza posts are just a
replacement of them. It is required that you read the posts and decide
which of them are relevant for you. In a lecture room you will find
also that one student asks a question, while the professor answers the
question to the entire class.

I find the hosting Web confusing
--------------------------------

Once in a while we find that a student finds the hosting of the class
material on the class Web page confusing. This confusion can be
overcome by doing the following:

1. You may have to take time to explore the Web page and identify what
   needs to be done for the class. However each class has a clear
   overview page.
2. You may have to learn to get used to a class that allows you to work
   ahead. 
3. You may have to learn to appreciate the additional material that
   assist in learning about python, ansible, LaTex, or the many other
   topics
4. Please do not blame the instructors for things that are out of
   their control: You may not be aware that it is not the instructors
   fault that the university is not able to provide us with an EdX
   server that works for us. Our choice would be to use EdX.

   
I524: I do not know python. What do I do?
-----------------------------------------

This class requires python. Please learn it. We will be using ansible
for the project. This you can acquire as part of the class through
self study. There is a section under lessosn that has some elementary
python included.


How to solve merge conflict in Pull Request?
--------------------------------------------

Make sure you have upstream repo defined::

  $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/cloudmesh/classes

 

Backup all your changed files - just in case you need them while merging the changes back

 

Get latest from upstream::

  $ git rebase upstream/master

 

In this step, the conflicting file shows up (in my case it was refs.bib)::

  $ git status

should show the name of the conflicting file::

  $ git diff <file name>

should show the actual differences. In some cases, it is easy to
simply take latest version from upstream and reapply your changes. So
you can decide to checkout one version earlier of the specific file.


.. note::
   
   You can find the version number with::

     $ git log --oneline

   You can checkout a specific version with::

     $ git checkout <version number - e.g. ed13c06> <file name>


At this stage, the re-base should be complete. So, you need to commit
and push the changes to your fork::

  $ git commit
  $ git rebase origin/master
  $ git push


Then reapply your changes to refs.bib - simply use the backedup
version and use the editor to redo the changes.

At this stage, only refs.bib is changed::

  $ git status

should show the changes only in refs.bib.

Commit this change using:: 

  $ git commit -a -m "new:usr: <message>"

 

And finally push the last commited change::

  $ git push

 

The changes in the file to resolve merge conflict automatically goes
to the original pull request and the pull request can be merged
automatically

Cheat sheet for Linux commands
------------------------------

Usage of a particular command and all the attributes associated with
it, use 'man' command. Avoid using 'rm -r' command to delete files
recursively. A good way to avoid accidental deletion is to include the
following in your .bash_profile file::

  alias e=open_emacs
  alias rm='rm -i'
  alias mv='mv -i' 
  alias h='history'

Tips: TechList.1 homework
-------------------------
 
.. warning:: why is this not placed in techlist-hw.rst?

Citations
---------

Do not mention the authors of a citation that you use. 

Example do not say:

As Gregor von Laszewski pointed out with flowery words in an article published recently .... [1]

Instead use: In [1] ...    

Naturally you should use the \cite command.
 
Spelling
--------

* use a space after periods, and commas in a centence
* use a spellchecker
* do the indentation properly as demonstrated in the examples. (use
  fixed width font to edit RST to see it more easily)

Github
------

* when dounig your pull request, make sure you do not have any conflists, rebase if needed

Rubric
------
 
We already commented on what a good entry looks like so its rather
simple, avoid plagiarism, subsections in the text, keep bullet lists
minimal, be short but provide enough detail, dont just copy from the
web page, relate technology to big data if you can

 

* a write a good introdcution to the technology that summarizes what
  it is (and if possible how it relates to big data)

* include the most important refernces and prepare them in correct
  bibtex format

* check in your contribution (obviously if you can not do that ask for
  help form the TAs so you get educated on git)

* you get 50% of your points from the writeup and 50% of the points
  from the bibliography

 
You are allowed to work in teams to improve your own submissions. 

     
Timeliness
----------

You will safe yourself a lot of hazle if you check in your assignment
early.  ON the last day typically a lot of checkins happen and may
require you to do a rebase. The sooner you do it the easier for you.

 

 

Outdated Tech ology
-------------------

One of the technology assigned to me is 'Ninefold'. It seems ninefold
has shutdown their cloud service on January 30, 2016. Should I write a
tech summary for ninefold or do we have remove this from the techlist
as it is no longer in operation?

 

Kindly refer: 

http://ninefold.com/

http://ninefold.com/news/

 

Note: Outdated and unnecessary technologies will be removed by the TAs. 


Techlist 1 and Paper 1 : Pagecount
----------------------------------

TechLIst = a couple of paragraphs (so real short, see the NAGIOS example

 

Paper 1 = 2 pages in the format we specified, images and refs not included. See at the end of the paper format for a suitable layout

 

PS: If your paper is longer or if it a paragraph short that does not matter to us, important is the content


Tips to Install Virtualbox
--------------------------
A video on how to install virtual box on windows 10 can be seen as part of an unrelated course on youtube at

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvCUpZuHgvo 

It is a bit wordy as the presenter complains about the difficulties to
record videos on windows 10, and talks about his course, so just
ignore these portions. Naturally use whatever is the newest
version. Here is one for Windows 8 which also contains ubuntu install
(use the one above on how to install vb on windows 10 and ignore that
part form the window bellow)

Do I generate the SSH key on Ubuntu VM ?
----------------------------------------

I have installed Ubuntu(on virtual box) on my windows 10 system. I
wanted to confirm if the SSH key should be created on the Ubuntu VM?
Yes we need to generate ssh on Ubuntu VM, because even it is a VM or a
real machine we have to set up ssh in order to work with ssh based
communication, in order to maintain security when you are using an
application like Github.

You need to generate SSH, no matter what operating system you are
using or on which operating system you are running VM.

First let us revisit what an ssh key is for. A key pair has a public
and a private key pair. If a remote machine has the public key from
another machine you will be able to login to that machine form the
machine where you have created the public and private key pair from.
Some services do require key authentication. Such services include:

a) login to any virtual machine

b) using github

c) login to the login nodes of futuresystems 

Thus if you like ta access any of them any computer on which you want
to access them from need a key pair. (or key as we sometimes
abbreviate).

So if you like to access from your ubuntu vm future systems which you
want you need one, if you want to access githu, you need one, if you
want to login to vas on chameleon cloud you need one, if you want to
login to vas on jetstreem you need one, if you want .... you need one.

 

So the answer is yes. Under no circumstances copy the private key to
another computer as that is a security violation. You can only copy
the public key. That is the reason its called public. On each machine
where you like to access these services you need to create a different
key and add the public key to the remote services/machines you want to
access.


Ways to run Ubuntu on Windows 10
--------------------------------

There are multiple ways to get ubuntu onto Windows.

a) The recommended way to do it is via virtual box which seems to work
for most, but requires sometimes that the bios settings need to be
adjusted. Naturally we do not know what your bios settings are so you
need to figure this out from the internet. However in 99% of the cases
virtual box works nicely.A student tip describes what needs to be
done:
 
You need the virtual box software
(https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) that corresponds to the
operating system running on the physical machine in front of you. Then
download the Ubuntu 16.04 .iso file
(https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) to your computer. Start
virtual box. I think a wizard starts to guide you through setting up a
new virtual machine when you choose "new". Then brows to where you
downloaded the iso file and click on it. you will have to start this
and ubuntu will start installing. (improve this description if
something is not clear)

b) the other way of installing bash on windows is as subsystem as
documented by your fellow students. This may not fulfill the
requirements of running ansible, but it will help you to get started
quickly while running bash on your host directly. It is often referred
to as "ubuntu on windows".

Don't use Anaconda
------------------

We use python 2.7.13 for this class. It is better to use Virtualenv
and pip. And for the IDE, you can use PyCharm. This is the open source
way of doing python, while we use 2.7 because not everything is yet
available in 3.5. We do not recommend Anaconda or Canopy. In fact we
found issues with both. Especially with Canopy. It was incompatible
with libraries the open source community uses and it negatively
effected a students system wide python install. We had to reinstall
python completely after we uninstalled canopy. Unfortunately it did
cost us a lot of time to fix this. TAs will not provide any help in
case you use anaconda or canopy.


Using SSH Key for Git Push
--------------------------

When you cloned your repository did you use SSH rather than HTTPS?
Your clone command should look like this:

$ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/classes.git

You can use git remote set-url as described here to change from HTTPS
to SSH: https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-remote-s-url/

Changing the origin remote (as opposed to both origin and upstream)
will be sufficient, since this is the only one you push into.




Can I write the papers on OSX?
------------------------------

Yes of course you can write papers on OSX. But we support for Ubuntu
16.04, because we consider it as the main OS that we use in this
class.  You can use, VM to install Ubuntu and use it for class work.

What is the nature of team collaboration on papers
--------------------------------------------------

You can build teams of three. You need to yourself build the team. The
web page tells you that there will be no reduction in numbers of
papers you write = number of team members * 3, papers can not be
combined.

Please note in all these cases it is highly recommended that you install into a virtualenv and not into the global package space. This is not specific to cryptography but rather is generic advice to keep your Python installation reliable. The global package space in OS provided Pythons is owned by the system and installing things via pip into it is asking for trouble.

Windows
-------
Upgrade to the latest pip (8.1.2 as of June 2016) and just pip install cryptography

cryptography and cffi are both shipped as statically linked wheels.

OS X
----
Ono OSX you need to install xcode.

Upgrade to the latest pip (8.1.2 as of June 2016) and just pip install cryptography

cryptography and cffi are both shipped as statically linked wheels. This will work for pyenv Python, system Python, homebrew Python, etc. As long as you're on the latest pip you won't even need a compiler.

Linux
-----
On Linux you'll need a C compiler, libffi + its development headers, and openssl + its development headers.

Debian or Ubuntu derived distributions

apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev followed by::

  pip install cryptography

Red Hat derived distributions::

  yum install gcc openssl-devel libffi-devel python-devel followed by

  pip install cryptography


Tips to write a Good Paper
--------------------------

This that must be avoided to write a good paper.

Why Technology xyz

(and makeing sure to include a ? ;)

Instead give the section a good name that is not a question, such as 

Introduction

Design

Architecture

Performance

Comparison

Big Data Use cases

Conclusion

And there are many more different things.

Make sure to write a good paper avoiding these headings when you start a sub-section in your paper.
