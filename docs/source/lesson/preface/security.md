# Security

These instructions are primarily developed for Smith
Research Center. Please note that at other locations instructors may not have weather
radios and you will have to apply your own judgement. Also make sure
that in all locations you are you know where your nearest Tornado
shelter is.

## Windows and sliding doors

The building has a small number of windows and sliding doors that can be opened. They are not to be used.

## Tornado

We experience an average of more than 20 tornadoes a year in Indiana, and the best way to protect yourself should one strike your location is to be prepared. Knowing the difference between a watch and warning can help you determine the risks you may face. A tornado "watch" means that weather conditions have the potential to create a tornado in the area, while a "warning" means that a tornado has been sighted. 

### Things you should do

* When you find out there is a tornado warning for your location, get inside a building, get away from exterior walls and windows, and go down as far as you can.
* If you are in a car and a tornado is near, get out of your car and get inside a building, or lie in a ditch and protect your head with your hands.
* Instructors will have a weather radio and ensure it has full batteries in it.
* Instructors will take the weather radio with them to where you seek shelter to stay updated on the situation.

### Things you should NOT do

* Never wait for a siren to be sure if the danger is real; always head for shelter as soon as you get an alert from the National Weather Service. IU-Notify, or an Instructor or other IU employees.
* Don’t rely on IU-Notify for weather warnings. Your instructors will be paying attention to the weather radio and/or the National Weather Service apps on their phones. 
* Don’t leave your shelter until an all clear has been given.
* Never seek shelter under a bridge; the bridge will act as a funnel and strengthen the winds underneath.

## Fire

Evacuate if

* A fire alarm is sounding
* There is the presence of fire, smoke, or the odor of burning in the building
* If you discover a fire, explosion or smoke in a building, inform your instructor who will activate the nearest fire alarm and proceed to evacuate, following the evacuation procedures here. 

## Drills

* Instructors will inform students of the location to meet in a case of a Tornado.
* Instructors will inform students how to leave the building in case of a fire and where to meet. Be prepared for a headcount and let an instructor know if one of your classmates is missing.

## Workspace Security

### Workplace Organization

Tools and other equipment may be shared with the class. 
After use they must be returned to the tools section.

### Scissors, Knifes and other Sharp tools

Underage students are not allowed to use scissors, knifes, or other
sharp tools including screwdrivers without parental consent. Such
tools must not be used inappropriately. Failure to use them
appropriately can result in expulsion from class.

### Soldering

Underage students are not allowed to use soldering tools without parental consent.

### Knowledge of Electricity

As we are using electricity and the devices we may use are expensive
no device may be used in a form so that they are broken on purpose.
The experiment needs to be understood. If not, read the manuals, work
with the assistants, and get informed. Do the experiment in theory
before "hacking". The same is valid with the code.

### Robot Car Security

#### Robot Floor

Robots are run on white boards in the middle of the room. You are not
allowed to walk without permission across these boards as they need to
be kept clean for the robots. If you need to pick up a robot please
make sure to have clean shoes. If you do leave marks on the board we
may ask you to clean them up yourself.

#### Robot Table Frames

Before running robots on the table you will get a table frame so that
the robots is prevented to fall off the table.

#### Robot Tripods

A number of tripods are placed in the room. The tripods have a
positioning sensor mounted on them and moving or touching the tripots
will affect the sensors. The tripods are not to be touched. Failure
may result in expulsion from the class

### Drone Security

#### Drone Tripods

A number of tripods are placed in the room. The tripods have a
positioning sensor mounted on them and moving or touching the tripots
will effect the sensors. The tripods are not to be touched. Failure
may result in expulsion from the class.

#### Drone Nets

In case drones will be used in the camp, drones must not be flown in
the open areas. Instead they will be positioned behind a net. In case
you experiment with drones on your desk, they must be secured with a
fishing line and you must wear safety goggles. These nets are not
climbing nets. They should also not be used to hang on them. They
present a safety barrier between you and the area where the drones
fly. Other than opening the dedicated entry points to the flying area
the nets must not be touched. Failure to do so may result in expulsion
from the class.
