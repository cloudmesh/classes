Web Page
============

Contributing content to this web page is easy. First you have to fork
the repository while going to the link:

* https://github.com/cloudmesh/classes

And press the fork icon. Now you can clone or directly manipulate your
fork from the web browser. If you clone, you need to make sure you
clone from your fork.

Next, you cen cd to the `classes` directory and make the
modifications. Check them locally with::

  make html 
  make view

To change things you can simply edit files in the docs/source
directory. Commit the changes and push them into your local fork. Now
you can create on the web page for the classes a pull request.

If accepted the request will be merged and you will be credited via
your github account. Make sure you use git config to set your name and e-mail.


Please also make sure you do not confuse github and gitlab. While this
web page is located in github, your activities for the class are done
in gitlab.

Exercise
--------

Contrib.1:
   Identify a spelling error in the web page, or another item
   to improve. Fork the Web page, fix the error and create a pull request.

Contrib.2:
   Identify a section that is not covered by this material, but could
   be useful. Add such a section and create a pull request so your
   contribution can be added. Work with others that review your
   section before submitting so we make sure no one else is working on
   this already. If they do we bring you in contact with them.
